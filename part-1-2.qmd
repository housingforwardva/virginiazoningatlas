## How to make a zoning atlas

The methods to standardize zoning ordinances across multiple jurisdictions were first employed in Connecticut in 2021. Dr. Sara Bronin, both an architect and attorney, developed "How To Make A Zoning Atlas" along with Ilya Illyankou to document their initial work on the Connecticut Zoning Atlas, which has led to the founding of the National Zoning Atlas (NZA).

Based out of the Legal Constructs Lab at Cornell University, the NZA team has contributed to a refinement of the zoning atlas methodology into a [2.0 version](https://www.zoningatlas.org/how).

The methodology provides a way to translate and standardize district-specific regulations based on the treatment of certain residential uses. 

*Zoning District Classification*

- Primarily Residential:
- Mixed with Residential:
- Nonresidential:
- Overlay Not Affecting Use:


*Residential Treatments*

- Prohibited:

- 1-Family:
- 2-Family:
- 3-Family:
- 4+-Family:
- Affordable Housing:
- Accessory Dwelling Units:
- Planned Residential Development:


## Why do this on a region-by-region basis?

Housing markets are regional in nature.
