The Virginia Zoning Atlas is a research project of HousingForward Virginia with support from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The Atlas is an ongoing collaborative effort to map and standardize zoning across the Commonwealth. The Atlas helps visualize the impact of zoning on housing development and allows for cross-jurisdictional comparisons for deeper zoning analysis.

The Virginia Zoning Atlas is part of the larger National Zoning Atlas, which "aims to depict key aspects of zoning codes in an online, user-friendly map.  It will enable comparisons across jurisdictions, illuminate regional and statewide trends, and strengthen national planning for housing production, transportation infrastructure, and climate response."
