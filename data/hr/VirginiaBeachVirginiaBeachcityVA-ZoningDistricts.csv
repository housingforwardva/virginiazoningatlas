This seems to be a common problem with VA Beach zoning. 

Audrey -- For districts with SF/1-family housing as the only allowed treatment, you will not find minimum unit size. FAR (floor-to-area) or max stories is sometimes also not included, so that is ok if you don't see it in VB or other Jurisdictions for Single Family residential districts! Also, I'm going to talk to Eric about this, but I *think* ADUS might be allowed here because of the smaller paragraph (b) below permitted uses. Don't worry about it, I'm just explaining why I added that and I'll take care of it. Once you read my response to you, just send this back for review and I'll finish it up.","The city council may grant a conditional use permit to allow residential development at a density greater than that which is permitted by right. The following regulations shall apply to residential development outside of the Interfacility Traffic Area in the AG-1 and AG-2 Agricultural Districts pursuant to this section. Max density may be 1 DU per 5 acres or 1 DU per 10 acres dependent on soil conditions. (§ 405.)

Regarding flex suites (ADUs): ""No flex suite may be constructed or occupied in any dwelling unless (i) the owner of record personally resides in such dwelling, (ii) the dwelling in which the flex suite is located is occupied by a person or group of persons meeting the definition of ""family"" set forth in section 111, or (iii) the flex suite or dwelling in which it is located is occupied by at least one (1) person who is sixty-two (62) years of age or older or disabled...""
