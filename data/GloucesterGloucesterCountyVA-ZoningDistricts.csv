This would support the absence of  RMX as an official district in the ordinance text. 

Using numbers from zoning ordinance update, to be finalized this spring: https://www.gloucesterva.info/1135/Zoning-Ordinance-Update 

Many contextual fields, including parking and setbacks. Using the setback from major roads/highways instead of from pedestrian walkway, per Atlas instructions. 

Regulations in B-2 override general requirements for townhouses and structures elsewhere in the ordinance. 

---
Eric's Notes:
The code defers to supplemental regulations for townhouse development for lot requirements. Those supplemental regulations will override the provisions in the base zoning district (see ""Minimum lot area: 2,500 square feet (or as specified in Article 9B Supplementary Use Regulations for specific uses)"" as an example).

Parking requirements exist in another part of the county's ordinances.

There's some mental gymnastics that have to be done based on the streetscape requirements in B2. When you add it all up, the setback requirements are actually 15 feet.","1-Family Treatment is limited to single-family attached (townhouse) development. Additional setback requirements are required if abutting SF-1, SC-1, C-2, RC-1, or RC-2.",0.06,0.06,0.06,0.06
