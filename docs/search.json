The Atlas is an ongoing collaborative effort to map and standardize zoning across the Commonwealth. The Atlas helps visualize the impact of zoning on housing development and allows for cross-jurisdictional comparisons for deeper zoning analysis.\nThe Virginia Zoning Atlas is part of the larger National Zoning Atlas, which “aims to depict key aspects of zoning codes in an online, user-friendly map. It will enable comparisons across jurisdictions, illuminate regional and statewide trends, and strengthen national planning for housing production, transportation infrastructure, and climate response.”"

    "text": "1.1 What is the Virginia Zoning Atlas?\nA zoning atlas is a large-scale, interactive map which displays municipal land use ordinance zones, or zoning districts, across all localities in a region, state, or country. The Virginia Zoning Atlas is part of the National Zoning Atlas Research Collaborative, which seeks to standardize zoning ordinances across the nation to show how restrictive land use policies are affecting housing production and affordability."

    "text": "1.2 Why is HousingForward Virginia doing this?\n\n\n\n\n\nHousingForward Virginia (HFV) has been a go-to resource for governments, non-profits, and private companies with a vested interest in affordable housing across the Commonwealth. Sourcebook, our free, online compendium of demographic and housing data, has been used to better understand housing needs. In addition, our Inclusionary Zoning Guidebook has helped educate Virginians on the opportunities and challenges of implementing inclusionary zoning. Furthermore, our contract research work has taken us across Virginia to understand the discussions and debates over zoning and the overall housing needs of Virginians.\nThe growing focus on land use practices and their impact on affordable housing has presented HFV with an opportunity to help Virginians better understand this connection. The VZA is aligned with our mission to provide free and impactful resources to better understand housing needs. But it is our hope that the VZA will provide boundless opportunities to others interested in exploring Virginia’s land use patterns and the zoning regulations that have created them.\n\n1.2.1 How restrictive are zoning regulations in Virginia?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Virginia Zoning Atlas is to answer major questions related to land use practices and housing development in the Commonwealth. By standardizing zoning districts across Virginia, HFV will be able to answer several questions important to the work of our audience, including:\n\nHow much developable land is dedicated to single-family detached housing?\nWhere in Virginia is it easiest to build small homes or starter homes?\nHow restrictive is land use policy in Virginia for the development of two-family homes? Accessory dwelling units? Multifamily buildings?\nHow much developable land in Virginia prevents the placement of manufactured homes on single lots or in parks?\n\nThe VZA will allow for comparisons across jurisdictions and open the door to investigations of land use policies beyond just housing. With standardization, we can better understand patterns at the regional and statewide levels."

Therefore, the atlas will largely benefit those who have an interest in housing (e.g. developers, builders, housing nonprofits, advocates, land use attorneys, etc.). The map will detail where different types of residential uses are allowed by-right, required to have a public approval process, or prohibited."

    "title": "2  Methodology",
    "section": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas",
    "text": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas\nThe methods to standardize zoning ordinances across multiple jurisdictions were first employed in Connecticut in 2021. Dr. Sara Bronin, both an architect and attorney, developed “How To Make A Zoning Atlas” along with Ilya Illyankou to document their initial work on the Connecticut Zoning Atlas, which has led to the founding of the National Zoning Atlas (NZA).\nBased out of the Legal Constructs Lab at Cornell University, the NZA team has contributed to a refinement of the zoning atlas methodology into a 2.0 version. This most current methodology was employed in the analysis for the Hampton Roads region in the summer of 2023.\nThe methodology provides a way to translate and standardize district-specific regulations based on the treatment of certain residential uses. Currently, the methodology requires analysts to manually read through pages and pages of zoning ordinances. Geographic data needs to be collected and sometimes created. Information can be hard to track down and may only be stored on paper in a physical location in some cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLike the people who write zoning ordinances, we’re human.\nAs we conduct our analysis and numerous reviews of the same zoning ordinance, we may not get our analysis right the first or even third time around. We welcome your review and feedback on the accuracy of the data, but also keep in mind that we are following a methodology that may not align with your interpretation of your zoning ordinance. See next section for some of these discrepancies!\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Important Definitions\nZoning District Classification\n\nPrimarily Residential means a district allows for: “housing only; housing and assorted uses customarily allowed in residential areas, including religious institutions and schools; or housing and agricultural uses.”\nMixed with Residential means a district allows for: “nonresidential uses and housing, whether the housing is stand-alone housing (e.g., apartment buildings) or housing integrated with nonresidential uses (e.g., buildings with retail on the ground floor and residential above). Nonresidential uses likely to be found in districts also allowing residential uses include retail shops, restaurants, office or medical buildings, performance venues, as well as certain light industrial uses (warehouses, small scale manufacturing, breweries, etc.)”\nNonresidential means a district either prohibits “residential uses entirely; or [allows] one accessory dwelling on the same lot as a nonresidential use and no other types of residential housing. Common examples of the latter include an apartment for a retailer to live above her shop or a caretaker apartment for a factory.\nOverlay Not Affecting Use simply means that an overlay district does not affect the allowable uses in a district. For example, a historic district overlay may require certain design parameters, but does not allow or prohibit additional uses on top of the base zoning district.\n\nResidential Treatments\n\nAllowed/Conditional means that a use is allowed without a public hearing. In this case, permission to build is subject to administrative review by a local planner and is typically allowed by-right if it meets the conditions of the zoning ordinance.\nPublic Hearing means that a use requires a public approval process (entitlement) in order to be built. In Virginia, entitlement can take different forms, but is most often a Special or Conditional Use Permit (SUP or CUP), a Special Exception or Variance, or a rezoning.\nProhibited means that a use is not allowed within that district.\n1-Family refers to a building, including a manufactured or mobile home, with only one dwelling unit. 1-Family is not only detached housing, but also includes attached housing that exist on individual lots (i.e. townhomes, semidetached, etc.).\n2-Family refers to two dwelling units within a single or two separate buildings that exist on a single lot. 2-Family zoning allows for two dwellings of equal size. 2-Family is most often referred to as a duplex, semidetached, or two-family dwelling, but is only two family if allowing both units to exist on a single lot.\n3-Family refers to three dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 3-Family is most often referred to as a triplex, but many localities define “multifamily” as a building with 3 or more units.\n4+-Family refers to four-or-more dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 4+-Family is most often referred to as an apartment or multifamily building depending on how a locality defines those terms, but it can also be a fourplex if only containing four dwelling units.\nAffordable Housing identifies which districts treat affordable housing differently from housing that is not designated as affordable, or where a district only allows for affordable housing.\nAccessory Dwelling Units are defined by the methodology as “a single unit of housing located on the same lot as a principal use, usually a 1-family home, and typically smaller than or in some other way subordinate to that principal use.” But according to the methodology, an ADU not need only be a secondary dwelling related to a 1-family home. It can also be a caretaker’s apartment that is accessory to a nonresidential use like a cemetery.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) “allows for a large number of housing units to be developed in accordance with a coordinated master plan, and offers flexibility with respect to grouping, placement, size, and use of structures. They may be permitted in multiple buildings, may be built on a single large lot or on many smaller lots (e.g., a subdivision on a large tract of land, though note that not all subdivisions are PRDs). They may include cluster developments that are planned to be denser than the zoning district otherwise allows.”"

While renters and buyers may want to live a specific community, the lack of supply and affordability in one community often drives them to search for housing options within a region where they can still be close to their job, friend and family, and community amenities.\nWhile locality’s think of zoning and land use policy within their boundaries, their policy decisions have impact across an entire region."

    "text": "5.3 Jobs Market\nThe importance of affordable housing to a thriving economy cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts various facets of economic well-being. By providing stable living conditions and reducing the financial burden on households, affordable housing enhances workforce productivity and stability, ensuring that employees can live close to their workplaces. This proximity not only reduces commuting times but also supports local businesses and stimulates economic growth. Moreover, affordable housing fosters economic mobility, allowing individuals and families to invest in education, job training, and entrepreneurship, ultimately leading to higher incomes and reduced reliance on social services. Affordable housing is an economic catalyst that promotes financial security, encourages consumer spending, and contributes to a more equitable and thriving economy for all.\nA Jobs-Housing Fit ratio helps measure the imbalance between low-wage workers and housing that is affordable to them. For example, a ratio of 5.0 means that five low wage workers compete for every one home considered affordable to them. Ratios closer to 1.0 or 2.0 offer more balance assuming that there is only one worker per household. But keep in mind that these ratios are at the jurisdiction-level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Jobs-Housing Fit in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nCommunity-level jobs-housing fit is more indicative of the balance as low wage workers can find more stability from jobs that are close to them. Furthermore, jobs in closer proximity help cut down on traffic congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Jobs-Housing Fit Ratio in Hampton Roads by Block Group"

Localities have significant control over their supply through their zoning ordinances.\nThe following findings are based on the Zoning Atlas Methodology and takes into account the impact of federally-owned lands and wetland areas, which are both prevalent throughout the region. Like our colleagues in New Hampshire, we have sought to exclude areas of land that are not unbuildable. We have excluded all federal land from calculations, as well as area of wetlands and/or water that are 10 continguous area or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFederal lands were identified using ESRI Landscape’s USA Federal Lands feature layer, which accounted for lands managed by six federal agencies, including:\n\nBureau of Land Management\nDepartment of Defense\nNational Park Service\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service\nUS Forest Service\n\nWetland/water areas were identified using the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service’s Seamless Wetlands Data.
