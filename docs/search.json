The Atlas is an ongoing collaborative effort to map and standardize zoning across the Commonwealth. The Atlas helps visualize the impact of zoning on housing development and allows for cross-jurisdictional comparisons for deeper zoning analysis.\nThe Virginia Zoning Atlas is part of the larger National Zoning Atlas, which “aims to depict key aspects of zoning codes in an online, user-friendly map. It will enable comparisons across jurisdictions, illuminate regional and statewide trends, and strengthen national planning for housing production, transportation infrastructure, and climate response.”"

    "text": "1.2 Why is HousingForward Virginia doing this?\n\n\n\n\n\nHousingForward Virginia (HFV) has been a go-to resource for governments, non-profits, and private companies with a vested interest in affordable housing across the Commonwealth. Sourcebook, our free, online compendium of demographic and housing data, has been used to better understand housing needs. In addition, our Inclusionary Zoning Guidebook has helped educate Virginians on the opportunities and challenges of implementing inclusionary zoning. Furthermore, our contract research work has taken us across Virginia to understand the discussions and debates over zoning and the overall housing needs of Virginians.\nThe growing focus on land use practices and their impact on affordable housing has presented HFV with an opportunity to help Virginians better understand this connection. The VZA is aligned with our mission to provide free and impactful resources to better understand housing needs. But it is our hope that the VZA will provide opportunities to others interested in exploring Virginia’s land use patterns and the zoning regulations that have created them.\n\n1.2.1 How restrictive are zoning regulations in Virginia?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Virginia Zoning Atlas is to answer major questions related to land use practices and housing development in the Commonwealth. By standardizing information about zoning districts across Virginia, HFV will be able to answer several questions important to the work of our audience, including:\n\nHow much developable land is dedicated to single-family detached housing?\nWhere in Virginia is it easiest to build small homes or starter homes?\nHow restrictive is land use policy in Virginia for the development of two-family homes? Accessory dwelling units? Multifamily buildings?\nHow much developable land in Virginia prevents the placement of manufactured homes on single lots or in parks?\n\nThe VZA will allow for comparisons across jurisdictions and open the door to investigations of land use policies beyond just housing. With standardization, we can better understand patterns at the regional and statewide levels."

    "section": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas",
    "text": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas\nThe methods to standardize zoning ordinances across multiple jurisdictions were first employed in Connecticut in 2021. Sara Bronin, an architect and attorney, worked with Ilya Ilyankou to develop the Connecticut Zoning Atlas, and Bronin went on to found the National Zoning Atlas (NZA). The NZA team has drafted a How to Make a Zoning Atlas guide to be used by all NZA project collaborators.\nBased out of the Legal Constructs Lab at Cornell University, the NZA team has contributed to a refinement of the zoning atlas methodology into a 2.0 version. This most current methodology was employed in the analysis for the Hampton Roads region in the summer of 2023.\nThe methodology provides a way to translate and standardize district-specific regulations based on the treatment of certain residential uses. Currently, the methodology requires analysts to manually read through pages and pages of zoning ordinances. Geographic data needs to be collected and sometimes created. Information can be hard to track down and may only be stored on paper in a physical location in some cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLike the people who write zoning ordinances, we’re human.\nAs we conduct our analysis and numerous reviews of the same zoning ordinance, we may not get our analysis right the first or even third time around. We welcome your review and feedback on the accuracy of the data, but also keep in mind that we are following a methodology that may not align with your interpretation of your zoning ordinance. See next section for some of these discrepancies!\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Important Definitions\nZoning District Classification\n\nPrimarily Residential means a district allows for: “housing only; housing and assorted uses customarily allowed in residential areas, including religious institutions and schools; or housing and agricultural uses.”\nMixed with Residential means a district allows for: “nonresidential uses and housing, whether the housing is stand-alone housing (e.g., apartment buildings) or housing integrated with nonresidential uses (e.g., buildings with retail on the ground floor and residential above). Nonresidential uses likely to be found in districts also allowing residential uses include retail shops, restaurants, office or medical buildings, performance venues, as well as certain light industrial uses (warehouses, small scale manufacturing, breweries, etc.)”\nNonresidential means a district either prohibits “residential uses entirely; or [allows] one accessory dwelling on the same lot as a nonresidential use and no other types of residential housing. Common examples of the latter include an apartment for a retailer to live above her shop or a caretaker apartment for a factory.\nOverlay Not Affecting Use simply means that an overlay district does not affect the allowable uses in a district. For example, a historic district overlay may require certain design parameters, but does not allow or prohibit additional uses on top of the base zoning district.\n\nResidential Treatments\n\nAllowed/Conditional means that a use is allowed without a public hearing. In this case, permission to build is subject to administrative review by a local planner and is typically allowed by-right if it meets the conditions of the zoning ordinance.\nPublic Hearing means that a use requires a public approval process (entitlement) in order to be built. In Virginia, entitlement can take different forms, but is most often a Special or Conditional Use Permit (SUP or CUP), a Special Exception or Variance, or a rezoning.\nProhibited means that a use is not allowed within that district.\n1-Family refers to a building, including a manufactured or mobile home, with only one dwelling unit. 1-Family is not only detached housing, but also includes attached housing that exist on individual lots (i.e. townhomes, semidetached, etc.).\n2-Family refers to two dwelling units within a single or two separate buildings that exist on a single lot. 2-Family zoning allows for two dwellings of equal size. 2-Family is most often referred to as a duplex, semidetached, or two-family dwelling, but is only two family if allowing both units to exist on a single lot.\n3-Family refers to three dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 3-Family is most often referred to as a triplex, but many localities define “multifamily” as a building with 3 or more units.\n4+-Family refers to four-or-more dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 4+-Family is most often referred to as an apartment or multifamily building depending on how a locality defines those terms, but it can also be a fourplex if only containing four dwelling units.\nAffordable Housing identifies which districts treat affordable housing differently from housing that is not designated as affordable, or where a district only allows for affordable housing.\nAccessory Dwelling Units are defined by the methodology as “a single unit of housing located on the same lot as a principal use, usually a 1-family home, and typically smaller than or in some other way subordinate to that principal use.” But according to the methodology, an ADU not need only be a secondary dwelling related to a 1-family home. It can also be a caretaker’s apartment that is accessory to a nonresidential use like a cemetery.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) “allows for a large number of housing units to be developed in accordance with a coordinated master plan, and offers flexibility with respect to grouping, placement, size, and use of structures. They may be permitted in multiple buildings, may be built on a single large lot or on many smaller lots (e.g., a subdivision on a large tract of land, though note that not all subdivisions are PRDs). They may include cluster developments that are planned to be denser than the zoning district otherwise allows.”"

    "text": "4.1 Summary\n“Housing in Hampton Roads is less affordable than Northern Virginia, other pricey areas” by Ryan Murphy of WHRO brought major attention to the challenges faced by Hampton Roads residents. In Hampton Roads, 34 percent of households were cost-burdened in 2021, three percentage points more than households in the Washington, D.C. Metro Area (an area often cited for its unaffordability).\nAlthough Hampton Roads is relatively more affordable than other regions across the nation and even the Commonwealth, wages and incomes have failed to keep pace with growing housing demand. These challenges are most impacting renter households, even those with higher incomes."

    "text": "4.2 Population Trends\nFrom 2010 to 2022, the Hampton Roads has grown by over 85,000 new people (a five percent increase). Much of the growth in the region has been in less urban parts of the region, like James City County (+21%), Suffolk (+16%), Isle of Wight County (+14%), and Chesapeake (+14%). Some areas like Surry County (-7%) and even the City of Norfolk (-4%) had population decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Population change in the Hampton Roads region\n\n\n\n\nIn most jurisdictions across Hampton Roads, households have been getting smaller. From 2010 to 2021, the largest increases in households were among 1- and 2-person households, especially in Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. Three-person and 4-person or more households saw little growth, and in many cases declines during this time frame. Smaller household sizes have been linked to growing financial challenges.\nHouseholds are also aging in Hampton Roads. From 2010 to 2021, there was an increase of nearly 60,000 householders age 65 or older. There was only an increase of about 5,000 householders between the ages of 45 to 64 years old, while there was a net loss of householders 44 years old or younger. The loss of younger households in the region has significant impacts on the vitality of the region, leading to decreases in the labor force and tax base. As noted by Hamilton Lombard of the University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, “The military brings lots of young people to the area… but the region doesn’t offer enough other opportunities to retain them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in household size by tenure in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nAs many households age, many are continuing to shrink in size. From 2010 to 2021, the greatest increases in households were among 1- and 2-person households. These increases were most prevalent in the the cities of Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Newport News. Three- or more person households saw little growth during this time frame, and in some cases experienced declines, particularly in Newport News, Portsmouth, York County, and Gloucester County.\nThese trends among many others drive housing demand. As you read further, it is important to ask, “Is the region’s housing meeting the demands of the population?”"

    "text": "4.4 Jobs Market\nThe importance of affordable housing to a thriving economy cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts various facets of economic well-being. By providing stable living conditions and reducing the financial burden on households, affordable housing enhances workforce productivity and stability, ensuring that employees can live close to their workplaces. This proximity not only reduces commuting times but also supports local businesses and stimulates economic growth. Moreover, affordable housing fosters economic mobility, allowing individuals and families to invest in education, job training, and entrepreneurship, ultimately leading to higher incomes and reduced reliance on social services. Affordable housing is an economic catalyst that promotes financial security, encourages consumer spending, and contributes to a more equitable and thriving economy for all.\nA Jobs-Housing Fit ratio helps measure the imbalance between low-wage workers and housing that is affordable to them. For example, a ratio of 5.0 means that five low wage workers compete for every one home considered affordable to them. Ratios closer to 1.0 or 2.0 offer more balance assuming that there is only one worker per household. But keep in mind that these ratios are at the jurisdiction-level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Jobs-Housing Fit in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nCommunity-level jobs-housing fit is more indicative of the balance as low wage workers can find more stability from jobs that are close to them. This means that they can both live and work within a community, rather than having to commute out or move away to be closer to a job. Locating jobs closer to housing means shorter commute times for workers, but also overall reductions in traffic congestion. Public transportation infrastructure close to where low wage workers live and work can further help with economic stability and reduced traffic.\n\nThe map below shows the job-housing fit ratio at the Census Block Group-level based on a median earnings in 2020 for individuals with a high school degree in the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC Metro Area (Virginia part), which was $32,507. Affordable rent at this earnings would be $812.67.\nAreas that are marked as NA have no affordable units.\n\nMany localities in Hampton Roads seemingly have a balanced ratio as a whole, but drilling down to the community-level shows that almost all localities have imbalanced areas (i.e. areas that have more low wage workers than housing affordable to those workers).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Jobs-Housing Fit Ratio in Hampton Roads by Block Group\n\n\n\nFour of the top five industry occupations in the region have an annual median wage below $40,000. In order to not be cost-burdened, these occupations need a rent that ranges from $681 to $952, a rent that is hard to come by in the region. While Business and Financial Operations occupations can more than afford the average asking rent in the region ($1,384), they still find it difficult to find an affordable home to purchase in the region.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  Top 5 occupations in Hampton Roads in 2022 \n \n  \n    Industry \n    Total Employment \n    Annual Median Wage \n    Affordable Rent \n    Affordable Home Price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Office and Administrative Support Occupations \n    82,930 \n    $38,060 \n    $951.50 \n    $94,189 \n  \n  \n    Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations \n    69,100 \n    $27,240 \n    $681.00 \n    $56,921 \n  \n  \n    Sales and Related Occupations \n    67,490 \n    $30,030 \n    $750.75 \n    $66,530 \n  \n  \n    Transportation and Material Moving Occupations \n    61,100 \n    $36,940 \n    $923.50 \n    $90,331 \n  \n  \n    Business and Financial Operations Occupations \n    53,260 \n    $75,320 \n    $1,883.00 \n    $222,526 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDetermining what is affordable to a person can depend on a multitude of factors, but for the purposes of this analysis we made several assumptions to make informed estimates.\nFor renters, we calculated what a monthly rent at 30% of an individual’s income.\nFor homebuyers, we calculated a home price based on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 7.18% (which was the U.S. weekly average as of August 31, 2023), a 3% minimum down payment, and a monthly tax and insurance of $250.\n\n\nRenter\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2:  What can the typical renter afford in Hampton Roads? \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    Median Renter Household Income \n    Affordable Rent \n    Affordable Home Price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Poquoson \n    $82,917 \n    $2,072.92 \n    $248,693 \n  \n  \n    York County \n    $68,498 \n    $1,712.45 \n    $199,028 \n  \n  \n    Virginia Beach \n    $57,342 \n    $1,433.55 \n    $160,603 \n  \n  \n    James City County \n    $53,279 \n    $1,331.98 \n    $146,608 \n  \n  \n    Chesapeake \n    $48,233 \n    $1,205.82 \n    $129,228 \n  \n  \n    Suffolk \n    $45,664 \n    $1,141.60 \n    $120,380 \n  \n  \n    Gloucester County \n    $44,861 \n    $1,121.52 \n    $117,614 \n  \n  \n    Williamsburg \n    $43,920 \n    $1,098.00 \n    $114,373 \n  \n  \n    Newport News \n    $42,780 \n    $1,069.50 \n    $110,446 \n  \n  \n    Hampton \n    $41,058 \n    $1,026.45 \n    $104,515 \n  \n  \n    Norfolk \n    $40,434 \n    $1,010.85 \n    $102,366 \n  \n  \n    Southampton County \n    $40,110 \n    $1,002.75 \n    $101,250 \n  \n  \n    Portsmouth \n    $37,993 \n    $949.82 \n    $93,958 \n  \n  \n    Isle of Wight County \n    $37,938 \n    $948.45 \n    $93,768 \n  \n  \n    Surry County \n    $36,458 \n    $911.45 \n    $88,671 \n  \n  \n    Franklin \n    $28,655 \n    $716.38 \n    $61,794 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typical renter in most localities would struggle to afford the average asking rent ($1,384 in Q2 2023) in the region and would struggle further to afford homeownership. Even with a higher median renter income in jurisdictions like Poquoson, York County, and Virginia Beach, renter households still face challenges.\n\n\n\nAffordability challenges have continuously affected renter households the most in Hampton Roads. Over 50 percent of renters in the region are cost-burdened compared to 23 percent of homeowners. In recent years, cost burden has been affecting more and more higher income households. These trends can be directly tied to an increasing number of higher income households competing in the rental market due to lifestyle choices, but more often challenges in the homeownership market.\nThis places downward pressure on market affordable rental housing, forcing lower and middle-income households to compete with higher income households for quality rental housing stock. These challenges have also increased the number of single-family home rentals across the nation — further limiting the supply of resale housing, which is often more affordable than new construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Cost burden by income and tenure in Hampton Roads"

This includes prime agricultural land in the southern parts of Hampton Roads, where the preservation of open space and natural resources is a vital part of the region. Only three percent of the region’s developable land is classified as Mixed with Residential. Locally, Williamsburg (22%), York County (14%), and Newport News (13%) have the largest proportions of Mixed with Residential zoning types, while Surry County (0%), Southampton County (0%), and Isle of Wight County (less than 1%) have the least.\nWalkable, mixed use communities are increasingly desirable among all age groups. The ability to reach work, shopping, and leisure activities within walking distance supports healthy communities, but also supports diverse local business and job opportunities (think of areas like like Ghent in Norfolk or the ViBe District in Virginia Beach).\n\n5.3.1 Single-Family Detached Housing\nWhile single-family detached housing is a dream many aspire to, barriers to homeownership are making it difficult for many Hampton Roads residents to purchase a home.The previous section highlighted those challenges with current wages and high rental costs that are further limiting the ability to save for a home purchase. Furthermore, single-family detached only zoning can have major implications on equity and economic opportunity. Allowing for more diverse types of housing in single-family detached only zoning districts can help provide greater access to high opportunity areas for a diverse range of households - both in terms of race and ethnicity, and income.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Single-family detached only zoning in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nIn most Hampton Roads localities, the majority of developable land is dedicated to single-family detached only. Many of these localities are largely rural localities, where single-family detached housing is more appropriate in rural setting. But even in more urban and suburban areas like Virginia Beach, Hampton, Norfolk, and Newport News, a large proportion of those localities is dedicated to single-family detached only.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Percent of developable land dedicated to single-family detached only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 By-Right Housing\nWhen housing development requires a public hearing process, it can often come up against opposition from existing community members who have a preconceived notions about the impacts of increased density or new neighbors. The entitlement process, whether through a special use permit (or conditional use permit), variance, or rezoning can increase development costs and lead to project uncertainty. At a time when new housing is needed across the region, allowing for housing by-right (without a public hearing process) can streamline development and ensure that the housing supply is aligned with the demand.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2:  Percent of developable land that welcomes housing type by-right \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    Single-family \n    2-family \n    3-family \n    4+-family \n  \n \n\n  \n    Chesapeake \n    79% \n    4% \n    4% \n    4% \n  \n  \n    Franklin (city) \n    84% \n    13% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Gloucester \n    97% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Hampton \n    85% \n    7% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Isle of Wight \n    97% \n    1% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    James City \n    65% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Newport News \n    59% \n    12% \n    16% \n    17% \n  \n  \n    Norfolk \n    56% \n    12% \n    22% \n    23% \n  \n  \n    Poquoson \n    88% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Portsmouth \n    70% \n    16% \n    16% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Smithfield \n    89% \n    0% \n    3% \n    3% \n  \n  \n    Southampton \n    98% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Suffolk \n    88% \n    2% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Surry \n    100% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Surry (town) \n    93% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Virginia Beach \n    81% \n    11% \n    6% \n    6% \n  \n  \n    Williamsburg \n    63% \n    13% \n    10% \n    10% \n  \n  \n    Windsor \n    90% \n    3% \n    3% \n    3% \n  \n  \n    York \n    79% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, single-family is welcomed (without a public hearing) in nearly every locality by a wide margin, while 2+ family housing is only allowed by-right by less than seven percent in most localities. Areas like Newport News, Norfolk, and Williamsburg stand out as allowing much more than their neighbors. Portsmouth is notable for its allowance of duplexes and triplexes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Percent of developable land allowing for 2+ family housing by-right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Developable land zoned for 2+ family housing by-right\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Minimum lot sizes"

By building diverse types of housing along transit lines, localities can better connect residents to opportunity and foster less of a reliance on personal vehicle travel.\nTransit oriented development (TOD) maximizes a mix of land uses within walking distance of public transit. Sustainable growth strategies, like TOD, are already utilized in Norfolk, as well as in Chesapeake, with their Transportation Corridor Overlay District (TCOD).\nThe following map shows zoned land that allows for 2+ family housing by-right in Hampton Roads with the location of Hampton Roads Transit bus stops. A quarter mile buffer, which is typically the minimum distance people will walk to a transit stop, are included.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Hampton Roads Transit bus stops and zoned land allowing for 2+ family housing by-right\n\n\n\nThis map shows that many 2+ housing options are made available within bus stops, but there are still opportunities to increase transit access throughout the region by upzoning in strategic areas and/or expanding transit service."
