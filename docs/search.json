    "text": "1.2 Why is HousingForward Virginia doing this?\n\n\n\n\n\nHousingForward Virginia (HFV) has been a go-to resource for governments, non-profits, and private companies with a vested interest in affordable housing across the Commonwealth. Sourcebook, our free, online compendium of demographic and housing data, has been used to better understand housing needs. In addition, our Inclusionary Zoning Guidebook has helped educate Virginians on the opportunities and challenges of implementing inclusionary zoning. Furthermore, our contract research work has taken us across Virginia to understand the discussions and debates over zoning and the overall housing needs of Virginians.\nThe growing focus on land use practices and their impact on affordable housing has presented HFV with an opportunity to help Virginians better understand this connection. The VZA is aligned with our mission to provide free and impactful resources to better understand housing needs. It is our hope that the VZA will provide opportunities to others interested in exploring Virginia’s land use patterns and the zoning regulations that have created them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what is zoning?!\n\n\n\nNot sure about what zoning is? Or how it impacts housing affordability? Or even why you should care?\nZONED IN is HousingForward Virginia’s zoning education initiative, which focuses on breaking down what zoning is in simple language, while also exploring the ways in which zoning impacts housing, livability, and equity.\nVisit our ZONED IN Landing Page here to learn more.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 How restrictive are zoning regulations in Virginia?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Virginia Zoning Atlas is to answer major questions related to land use practices and housing development in the Commonwealth. By standardizing information about zoning districts across Virginia, HFV will be able to answer several questions important to the work of our audience, including:\n\nHow much developable land is dedicated to single-family detached housing?\nWhere in Virginia is it easiest to build small homes or starter homes?\nHow restrictive is land use policy in Virginia for the development of two-family homes? Accessory dwelling units? Multifamily buildings?\nHow much developable land in Virginia prevents the placement of manufactured homes on single lots or in parks?\n\nThe VZA will allow for comparisons across jurisdictions and open the door to investigations of land use policies beyond just housing. With standardization, we can better understand patterns at the regional and statewide levels.\nAs many localities take on zoning reform, the VZA can be used to track zoning over time to see how some Virginia jurisdictions may become less restrictive with their zoning."

    "section": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas",
    "text": "2.1 How to make a zoning atlas\nThe methods to standardize zoning ordinances across multiple jurisdictions were first employed in Connecticut in 2021. Sara Bronin, an architect and attorney, worked with Ilya Ilyankou to develop the Connecticut Zoning Atlas, and Bronin went on to found the National Zoning Atlas (NZA). The NZA team has drafted a How to Make a Zoning Atlas guide to be used by all NZA project collaborators.\nThe methodology provides a way to translate and standardize district-specific regulations based on the treatment of certain residential uses. Currently, the methodology requires analysts to manually read through pages and pages of zoning ordinances. Geographic data needs to be collected and sometimes created. Information can be hard to track down and may only be stored on paper in a physical location in some cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe kind!\n\n\n\nLike the people who write zoning ordinances, we’re human.\nAs we conduct our analysis and numerous reviews of the same zoning ordinance, we may not get our analysis right the first or even third time around. We welcome your review and feedback on the accuracy of the data, but also keep in mind that we are following a methodology that may not align with your interpretation of your zoning ordinance. See next section for some of these discrepancies!\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Important Definitions\nZoning District Classification\n\nPrimarily Residential means a district allows for: “housing only; housing and assorted uses customarily allowed in residential areas, including religious institutions and schools; or housing and agricultural uses.”\n\nMixed with Residential means a district allows for: “nonresidential uses and housing, whether the housing is stand-alone housing (e.g., apartment buildings) or housing integrated with nonresidential uses (e.g., buildings with retail on the ground floor and residential above). Nonresidential uses likely to be found in districts also allowing residential uses include retail shops, restaurants, office or medical buildings, performance venues, as well as certain light industrial uses (warehouses, small scale manufacturing, breweries, etc.)”\n\nNonresidential means a district either prohibits “residential uses entirely; or [allows] one accessory dwelling on the same lot as a nonresidential use and no other types of residential housing. Common examples of the latter include an apartment for a retailer to live above her shop or a caretaker apartment for a factory.\nOverlay Not Affecting Use simply means that an overlay district does not affect the allowable uses in a district. For example, a historic district overlay may require certain design parameters, but does not allow or prohibit additional uses on top of the base zoning district.\nResidential Treatments\n\nAllowed/Conditional means that a use is allowed without a public hearing. In this case, permission to build is subject to administrative review by a local planner and is typically allowed by-right if it meets the conditions of the zoning ordinance. It is important to understand that the word “Conditional” here should not be associated with a Conditional Use Permit!\nPublic Hearing means that a use requires a public approval process (entitlement) in order to be built. In Virginia, entitlement can take different forms, but is most often a Special or Conditional Use Permit (SUP or CUP), a Special Exception or Variance, or a rezoning.\nProhibited means that a use is not allowed within that district.\n1-Family refers to a building, including a manufactured or mobile home, with only one dwelling unit. 1-Family is not only detached housing, but also includes attached housing that exist on individual lots (i.e. townhomes, semidetached, etc.).\n2-Family refers to two dwelling units within a single or two separate buildings that exist on a single lot. 2-Family zoning allows for two dwellings of equal size. 2-Family is most often referred to as a duplex, semidetached, or two-family dwelling, but is only two family if allowing both units to exist on a single lot.\n3-Family refers to three dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 3-Family is most often referred to as a triplex, but many localities define “multifamily” as a building with 3 or more units.\n4+-Family refers to four-or-more dwelling units within a single building or separate buildings on a single lot. 4+-Family is most often referred to as an apartment or multifamily building depending on how a locality defines those terms, but it can also be a fourplex if only containing four dwelling units.\nAffordable Housing identifies which districts treat affordable housing differently from housing that is not designated as affordable, or where a district only allows for affordable housing.\nAccessory Dwelling Units are defined by the methodology as “a single unit of housing located on the same lot as a principal use, usually a 1-family home, and typically smaller than or in some other way subordinate to that principal use.” But according to the methodology, an ADU not need only be a secondary dwelling related to a 1-family home. It can also be a caretaker’s apartment that is accessory to a nonresidential use like a cemetery.\nPlanned Residential Development (PRD) “allows for a large number of housing units to be developed in accordance with a coordinated master plan, and offers flexibility with respect to grouping, placement, size, and use of structures. They may be permitted in multiple buildings, may be built on a single large lot or on many smaller lots (e.g., a subdivision on a large tract of land, though note that not all subdivisions are PRDs). They may include cluster developments that are planned to be denser than the zoning district otherwise allows.”"

    "section": "3.1 Why does by-right housing development matter?",
    "text": "3.1 Why does by-right housing development matter?\nThe public approval process can be helpful to ensure that a development does not have negative impact on the existing community, but it can also stifle housing supply and affordability. Public hearings for housing developments can be subject to influence from Not-in-My-Backyard (NIMBY) opposition. Often the loudest voices at public meetings, NIMBYs can put a stop to projects even if they align with local comprehensive plans and housing needs.\nIt’s estimated that NIMBY opposition “adds an average of 5.6 percent to total development costs and delays the delivery of new housing by an average of 7.4 months.”1\nThe financial cost and risk associated with the public approval process can be costly and those costs ultimately translate to less affordability. Worse yet, a developer can spend significant amounts of money and not still not have a development be approved. One developer we talked to estimated that a 100 unit Low-Income Housing Tax Credit rezoning could cost the following:\n\nEstimated rezoning cost for a 100 unit LIHTC project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost\nTotal\nPer Unit\n\n\n\n\nRequired designs for rezoning submittal\n$50,000\n$500\n\n\nCompany overhead associated with rezoning process\n$30,000\n$300\n\n\nLegal fees associated with rezoning process\n$50,000\n$500\n\n\nTOTAL COST OF REZONING\n$130,000\n$1,300\n\n\n\nThese costs can range depending on the requirements of the jurisdiction. As the need for more housing continues, especially rental housing, delays of more housing can not only cost developers, but also residents.\nBy allowing for more by-right development of diverse housing types, jurisdictions can help eliminate risk and reduce costs, which can translate to more abundant housing options when it is needed the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info\n\n\n\nVisit our Zoning 101 Toolkit to learn more about the impacts of zoning on housing affordability."

    "section": "3.2 Getting ahead of questions and concerns",
    "text": "3.2 Getting ahead of questions and concerns\nAs you view the Virginia Zoning Atlas and the analyses that follow the completion of each region, you may have critiques or concerns about what is presented. Rest assured that there is a reason we did what we did and we have already thought about addressing your critique or concern in a future iteration of the atlas.\nBelow, we try to address some of these critiques or concerns early. Please address other comments and concerns to eric@housingforwardva.org.\n\n3.2.1 Why our definition may not align with yours\nTo standardize complex zoning ordinances, not only across Virginia but the entire nation, requires a rigorous adherence to common definitions and interpretations. The methodology developed by National Zoning Atlas team requires a specific reading of zoning ordinances that may not coincide with your or even a locality’s interpretation of their zoning ordinance.\n\n3.2.1.1 1-Family Treatment\nBased on the methodology, “1-family housing means a building, including a mobile home or a manufactured home, with only one dwelling unit. 1-family zoning permits one such building on each lot.”\nThis includes duplex, townhouse, or rowhouse development where each unit sits on an individual lot. For some localities, this type of development may be interpreted as 2+-Family housing, but to adhere to the definitions set out in the methodology, they are 1-Family.\nHFV is collecting additional information in our analysis to determine whether a zoning district allows for only single-family detached housing.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 2-Family Treatment\n\nSo what’s a 2-Family Treatment then? What is typically referred to as a duplex, two-family, or semi-detached housing is only 2-Family Treatment if both units sit on the same lot. Think of a building that has one dwelling on the ground floor and then another on the second. Sometimes they can be side-by-side. The distinction more often manifests itself in how the units are ultimately occupied (i.e. are they for sale or are they rented?). In most cases, 2-Family Treatments are rentals or condominiums.\n\n\n3.2.1.3 3-Family Treatment\nMost localities across Virginia define any building containing three or more units as multifamily. A few do make the distinction between smaller type of multifamily buildings like triplexs or fourplexes, but lumping 2-family, 3-family, and 4+-family together as multifamily would ignore the nuances that may exist between localities.\n\n\n3.2.1.4 Accessory Dwelling Units\nLocalities are increasingly seeing interest among residents for accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to increase their income, house a family member with special needs, or make their home more functional. This has led many localities to specifically define an ADU in their ordinance, often associated only with a single-family detached home.\nThe methodology does not only include these types of accessory dwelling units, but also dwelling units that are accessory to nonresidential uses. Some localities permit housing as an accessory to industrial, commercial, or retail uses. Consider a caretaker’s dwelling associated with a cemetery, or a single unit of housing above a retail store in a historic downtown. Both of these are accessory uses to a principal use, and legally speaking, ADUs!\n\n\n3.2.1.5 Manufactured Homes\nManufactured homes are an important source of affordable housing throughout the Commonwealth. As mentioned above, they are treated as 1-Family Treatment (even when they exist within a manufactured home park or community, where households rent the lot their home sits on).\nHFV plans to expand later capture the nuances of manufactured home zoning in a future iteration of the zoning atlas work.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 “Why is the zoning atlas missing [x]?”\nThe information that is presented in the zoning atlas is based on data that was accessible to Virginia Zoning Atlas analysts. We tried our best to get the most up-to-date zoning maps and ordinances from local staff. Some localities did not have certain overlay districts mapped and sometimes had districts that are described in their ordinance but not mapped.\nIndividual parcels within a zoning district may be zoned differently than what the district allows for because the owner went through the approval process to rezone the property. If this information is not captured by the jurisdiction’s zoning geospatial data, then it was not mapped.\n\n\n3.2.3 Other factors impact development\n\nWe fully acknowledge that other physical, regulatory, and political factors impact what can be built and where. Zoning regulations are just a piece of the puzzle (although a large one!) under local control.\n\nPreserving the natural resources of Virginia is important to environmental sustainability and our vitality. Developable land calculations in later sections do not currently account for conservation easements.\nSea-level rise along Coastal Virginia are an increasing cause for concern and further development along certain coastal areas is not encouraged by many localities.\nPublic water and sewer service areas are critical to support denser development. Including these areas as an additional layer in the zoning atlas would provide important context.\nBuilding codes also impact development.\nPublic input through the comprehensive planning process guides what type of development residents want to see in their community. But it is important that residents understand the implications of their choices in terms of affordability, economic development, and community livability.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 What about [x] or [y]?!\nWe’ve had several comments or questions about wishes for the zoning atlas to show specific things. Our adherence to the current zoning atlas methodology is important for standardization purposes, but also to streamline this work. We hope that the completion of the Virginia Zoning Atlas as it is currently designed will act a proof of concept to Virginians to further garner support for this work.\nThere are numerous questions that we, as well as you, have about zoning in Virginia. We want to expand upon the Virginia Zoning Atlas in future iterations and maintain it as a free resource.\nBut this takes time, as well as funding. With additional funding, we can expand and maintain the Virginia Zoning Atlas to ask additional questions, like:\n\nHow restrictive is zoning for group homes or shelters?\nHow restrictive is zoning for manufactured homes?\nDo current lot requirements match the actual physical dimension of lots?\n\nDonating to support the Virginia Zoning Atlas here can help us address these other important questions!"

    "text": "4.1 Summary\n“Housing in Hampton Roads is less affordable than Northern Virginia, other pricey areas” by Ryan Murphy of WHRO brought major attention to the challenges faced by Hampton Roads residents. In Hampton Roads, 34 percent of households were cost-burdened in 2021, three percentage points more than households in the Washington, D.C. Metro Area (an area often cited for its unaffordability).\nWhile Hampton Roads may appear more affordable compared to other regions nationwide and within the Commonwealth, wage growth has not kept pace with rising housing demand. These challenges disproportionately impact renter households, including those with higher incomes."

    "text": "4.2 Population Trends\nFrom 2010 to 2022, Hampton Roads has grown by over 85,000 new people (a five percent increase). Much of the growth in the region has been in less urban parts of the region, like James City County (+21%), Suffolk (+16%), Isle of Wight County (+14%), and Chesapeake (+14%). Some areas like Surry County (-7%) and even the City of Norfolk (-4%) had population decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Population change in the Hampton Roads region\n\n\n\n\nIn most jurisdictions across Hampton Roads, households have been getting smaller. From 2010 to 2021, the largest increases in households were among 1- and 2-person households, especially in Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. Three-person and 4-person or more households saw little growth, and in many cases declines during this time frame. Smaller household sizes have been linked to growing financial challenges.\nHouseholds are also aging in Hampton Roads. From 2010 to 2021, there was an increase of nearly 60,000 householders age 65 or older. There was only an increase of about 5,000 householders between the ages of 45 to 64 years old, while there was a net loss of householders 44 years old or younger. The loss of younger households in the region has significant impacts on the vitality of the region, leading to decreases in the labor force and tax base. As noted by Hamilton Lombard of the University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, “The military brings lots of young people to the area… but the region doesn’t offer enough other opportunities to retain them.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Change in householders by age in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in household size by tenure in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nAs many households age, many are also shrinking in size. From 2010 to 2021, the greatest increases in households were among 1- and 2-person households. These increases were most prevalent in the cities of Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Newport News. Three- or more person households saw little growth during this timeframe, and in some cases experienced declines, particularly in Newport News, Portsmouth, York County, and Gloucester County.\nShrinking household size has real impacts on housing demand. Not only does it mean more homes are needed for more people, it also means that smaller-sized homes are needed. Diverse options provide flexibility for the ways in which households form or change, whether it be through marriage and kids, adult children moving out or in, a spouse passing away, or even just downsizing for better livability.\nThese trends among many others are drive housing demand. As you read further, it is important to ask, “Is the region’s housing meeting the demands of the population?”"

Throughout the region, few if any 2-4 unit housing (2%), typically referred to as Missing Middle Housing, was constructed.\nBefore the pandemic, home prices throughout the median single-family home price was $250,000 in Q2 2019. Record low interest rates in across the nation during the pandemic led to a heated housing market as many millennials entered homeownership. With interest rate increases in recent months, the home sales have decreased, but prices and competition have not.\nAs of Q2 2023, the median home price in the region sits at $335,000. The biggest jumps in price were in James City County, Williamsburg, and Surry County. James City County has the highest median home price in the region at $459,000, followed by York County ($410,560) and Poquoson ($400,000).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Median home sales price in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nDays on Market (DOM) is an indicator of how long it takes for a home to sell after being listed. Lower DOM can be indicative of higher demand and a heated market. A median DOM of 30 has been suggested as indicating a balanced market. Before the pandemic (Q2 2019), the median days on market in many localities sat around 30. As of Q2 2023, the majority of localities have a median DOM below 15 days. In higher priced markets like Williamsburg, James City County, York County, and Virginia Beach, the median DOM is fewer than 10 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Median days on market in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nWith increasing challenges to homeownership, the percentage of renters has been growing in nearly every Hampton Roads locality, with the Cities of Franklin and Williamsburg and James City County being the exceptions. The biggest leaps in the percentage of renters were in Newport News, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and York County. The increasing number of renters across the region has resulted in high rental demand and higher rental prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Percent of renter households in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nThe Hampton Roads rental market experienced stark changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant leaps in average asking rent from 2021 to 2022. Previously, average asking rent had increased by $10 to $30 annually, but from 2021 to 2022, rent had increased by over $100. By the second quarter of 2023, average asking rent stood at $1,384. To afford this without being financially strained, a household would need an annual income of $55,360.\nFor context, the HUD Area Median Income (AMI) limit for a two-person household at 50% AMI in the region is $37,400.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Average asking rent in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nThe rising rental prices are a sign of increasing demand. Subsequently, rental vacancy rates took a tumble from 2020 to 2021, with a historic low of 3.2% in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. Vacancy rates have since increased to 5.7% in Q2 2023 - still lower than any quarter before 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Rental vacancy in Hampton Roads"

    "text": "4.4 Jobs Market\nThe importance of affordable housing to a thriving economy cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts various facets of economic well-being. By providing stable living conditions and reducing the financial burden on households, affordable housing enhances workforce productivity and stability, ensuring that employees can live close to their workplaces. This proximity not only reduces commuting times but also supports local businesses and stimulates economic growth. Moreover, affordable housing fosters economic mobility, allowing individuals and families to invest in education, job training, and entrepreneurship, ultimately leading to higher incomes and reduced reliance on social services. Affordable housing is an economic catalyst that promotes financial security, encourages consumer spending, and contributes to a more equitable and thriving economy for all.\nA Jobs-Housing Fit ratio helps measure the imbalance between low-wage jobs and housing that is affordable to those jobs.\n\nThe ratio is calculated by dividing the number of low-wage jobs by the number of housing units that are affordable at that wage level.\nA ratio of 1.0 would mean a perfect fit: one low-wage job for each affordable housing unit, assuming one worker per household.\nRatios closer to 1.0 or 2.0 are generally considered more balanced. They indicate that the local housing market is better suited to meet the needs of low-wage earners.\nHigh ratios, such as 5.0, indicate an imbalance. In this case, there are five low-wage jobs for every one unit of affordable housing, suggesting that many workers may have to commute from other areas or choose housing that is unaffordable to them.\n\nFor example, a ratio of 5.0 means that there are five low-wage jobs for every unit of housing that is affordable at that wage. Ratios closer to 1.0 or 2.0 offer more balance assuming that there is only one worker per household. When ratios are high, this means that more low-wage workers need to commute in for work, putting additional pressure on Hampton Roads traffic. But keep in mind that these ratios are at the jurisdiction-level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Jobs-Housing Fit in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nAs the jobs market shifts with the changing economy, we can better see the balance or imbalance at the Census Block Group-level. The Census Block Group is a more reasonable way to measure the Jobs-Housing Fit ratio as it can better account for employment centers at the neighborhood-scale. Locating jobs closer to housing means shorter commute times for workers, but also overall reductions in traffic congestion. Public transportation infrastructure close to where low wage workers live and work can further help with economic stability and reduced traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs-Housing Fit In Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nThe map below shows the job-housing fit ratio at the Census Block Group-level based on a median earnings in 2020 for individuals with a high school degree in the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC Metro Area (Virginia part), which was $32,507. Affordable rent at this earnings would be $812.67.\nAreas that are marked as NA have no affordable units.\n\n\nMany localities in Hampton Roads seemingly have a balanced ratio as a whole, but drilling down to the community-level shows that almost all localities have imbalanced areas (i.e. areas that have more low wage workers than housing affordable to those workers).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Jobs-Housing Fit Ratio in Hampton Roads by Block Group\n\n\n\nFour of the top five industry occupations in the region have an annual median wage below $40,000. In order to not be cost-burdened, these occupations need a rent that ranges from $681 to $952, a rent that is hard to come by in the region. While Business and Financial Operations occupations can more than afford the average asking rent in the region ($1,384), they still find it difficult to find an affordable home to purchase in the region.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1:  Top 5 occupations in Hampton Roads in 2022 \n \n  \n    Industry \n    Total Employment \n    Annual Median Wage \n    Affordable Rent \n    Affordable Home Price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Office and Administrative Support Occupations \n    82,930 \n    $38,060 \n    $951.50 \n    $94,189 \n  \n  \n    Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations \n    69,100 \n    $27,240 \n    $681.00 \n    $56,921 \n  \n  \n    Sales and Related Occupations \n    67,490 \n    $30,030 \n    $750.75 \n    $66,530 \n  \n  \n    Transportation and Material Moving Occupations \n    61,100 \n    $36,940 \n    $923.50 \n    $90,331 \n  \n  \n    Business and Financial Operations Occupations \n    53,260 \n    $75,320 \n    $1,883.00 \n    $222,526 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring affordability\n\n\n\nDetermining what is affordable to a person can depend on a multitude of factors, but for the purposes of this analysis we made several assumptions to make informed estimates.\nFor renters, we calculated what a monthly rent at 30 percent of an individual’s gross income. This is based on the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) definition of affordable housing.\nFor homebuyers, we calculated a home price based on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 7.18% (which was the U.S. weekly average as of August 31, 2023), a 3% minimum down payment, and a monthly tax and insurance of $250. In addition, we assumed that a household would pay no more than 28 percent of their gross income due to lender preference for the 28/36 rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2:  What can the typical renter afford in Hampton Roads? \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    Median Renter Household Income \n    Affordable Rent \n    Affordable Home Price \n  \n \n\n  \n    Poquoson \n    $82,917 \n    $2,072.92 \n    $248,693 \n  \n  \n    York County \n    $68,498 \n    $1,712.45 \n    $199,028 \n  \n  \n    Virginia Beach \n    $57,342 \n    $1,433.55 \n    $160,603 \n  \n  \n    James City County \n    $53,279 \n    $1,331.98 \n    $146,608 \n  \n  \n    Chesapeake \n    $48,233 \n    $1,205.82 \n    $129,228 \n  \n  \n    Suffolk \n    $45,664 \n    $1,141.60 \n    $120,380 \n  \n  \n    Gloucester County \n    $44,861 \n    $1,121.52 \n    $117,614 \n  \n  \n    Williamsburg \n    $43,920 \n    $1,098.00 \n    $114,373 \n  \n  \n    Newport News \n    $42,780 \n    $1,069.50 \n    $110,446 \n  \n  \n    Hampton \n    $41,058 \n    $1,026.45 \n    $104,515 \n  \n  \n    Norfolk \n    $40,434 \n    $1,010.85 \n    $102,366 \n  \n  \n    Southampton County \n    $40,110 \n    $1,002.75 \n    $101,250 \n  \n  \n    Portsmouth \n    $37,993 \n    $949.82 \n    $93,958 \n  \n  \n    Isle of Wight County \n    $37,938 \n    $948.45 \n    $93,768 \n  \n  \n    Surry County \n    $36,458 \n    $911.45 \n    $88,671 \n  \n  \n    Franklin \n    $28,655 \n    $716.38 \n    $61,794 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typical renter in most localities would struggle to afford the average asking rent ($1,384 in Q2 2023) in the region and would struggle further to afford homeownership. Even with a higher median renter income in jurisdictions like Poquoson, York County, and Virginia Beach, renter households still face challenges. Based on these incomes, the typical renter could not afford the median sales price in the region of $335,000. At best, the typical renter in Poquoson could afford the median sales price in Portsmouth, but nowhere else.\nAffordability challenges have continuously affected renter households the most in Hampton Roads. Over 50 percent of renters in the region are cost-burdened compared to 23 percent of homeowners. In recent years, cost burden has been affecting more and more higher income households. These trends can be directly tied to an increasing number of higher income households competing in the rental market due to lifestyle choices, but more often challenges in the homeownership market.\nThis places downward pressure on market affordable rental housing, forcing lower and middle-income households to compete with higher income households for quality rental housing stock. These challenges have also increased the number of single-family home rentals across the nation — further limiting the supply of resale housing, which is often more affordable than new construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Cost burden by income and tenure in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nHousing affordability in Hampton Roads is also an issue of racial equity. In the region, the typical Black households makes over $33,000 less than the typical white household. This wide wealth gap has persisted across time and contributes to a disproportionate number of individuals identifying as Black represented in Point-in-Time counts of homelessness and housing cost burden.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Median household income by race and ethnicity in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\n\nBased on these median household incomes, what a typical Black household could afford in terms of rent and home purchase would far less than the typical white household. While a typical Black household in 2021 would barely be able to afford the average asking rent during that period, the typical white household would have no issue. In terms of home purchase, the average white household in the region could afford over $100,000 more than a Black household.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold Race/Ethnicity\n\n\nAffordable Rent\n\n\nAffordable Home Price\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic\n\n\n$2,109.32\n\n\n$253,708\n\n\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n$1,947.62\n\n\n$231,429\n\n\n\n\nMultiracial\n\n\n$1,838.07\n\n\n$216,336\n\n\n\n\nHispanic or Latino\n\n\n$1,657.40\n\n\n$191,444\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n$1,278.70\n\n\n$139,269\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Housing affordability by race and ethnicity\n\n\n\nWith a wide racial wealth gap and increasing housing costs, the issue of more diverse housing is also an issue of racial and ethnic diversity.

In many localities, the percentage is much higher.\n\nMinimum lot sizes for single-family detached housing are highest in Gloucster, Windsor, and Poquoson, but many jurisdictions in Hampton Roads have a minimum lot size between 0.5 to 1.0 acre.\n\nThe percent of land that you can build 2+ family housing is but a fraction of total developable land in most localities in Hampton Roads. Newport News (12%), Norfolk (11%), and Williamsburg (9%) stand out among their neighbors, but not by much.\nTwo jurisdictions — Hampton and Poquoson — employ minimum square footage requirements for housing.\nAll jurisdictions employ off-street parking requirements. For 4+-Family treatment, parking minimums range between 1 to 2.5 spaces depending on the number of bedrooms per unit. Some jurisdictions require additional spaces to account for visitors, while others do not.\nAccessory Dwelling Unit regulations vary greatly across the region, but many jurisdictions place significant restrictions on how they are used. Newport News and Chesapeake are notable for not allowing residential ADUs at all.\nThere are numerous opportunities to upzone areas within a quarter mile of public transit routes in the region.\nThroughout the region, there are areas with more low-wage jobs than there is housing affordable to those jobs. More by-right 4+-family housing in these areas can support these essential workers and a diverse economy."

Chesapeake’s zoning ordinance stood out to us as being overly complicated due to its use of a nontraditional use table. York County’s zoning ordinance was relatively straightforward."

    "text": "5.5 Single-family detached housing\nWhile single-family detached housing is a dream many aspire to, barriers to homeownership are making it difficult for many Hampton Roads residents to purchase a home. The previous section highlighted those challenges with current wages and high rental costs that are further limiting the ability to save for a home purchase. Furthermore, single-family detached only zoning can have major implications on equity and economic opportunity. Allowing for more diverse types of housing in single-family detached only zoning districts can help provide greater access to high opportunity areas for a diverse range of households - both in terms of race and ethnicity, and income.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Single-family detached only zoning in Hampton Roads\n\n\n\nIn most Hampton Roads localities, the majority of developable land is dedicated to single-family detached only. Many of these localities are largely rural localities, where single-family detached housing is more appropriate in a rural setting. But even in more urban and suburban areas like Virginia Beach, Hampton, Norfolk, and Newport News, a large proportion of those localities is dedicated to single-family detached only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable Jurisdiction\n\n\n\nIsle of Wight County is notable among its neighbors because it allows for two-family housing throughout many parts of the county, even in areas where single-family detached is predominant. The catch, however, is that it has to go through the conditional use permit process.\nYork County allows for single-family attached duplexes in a Cluster Techniques Open Space Development through the special use permit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Percent of developable land dedicated to single-family detached only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.1 Minimum lot sizes\nMaking generalizations about minimum lot sizes is difficult due to their variations depending on development context. Smaller lot sizes are more reasonable where public water and sewer infrastructure exist, while large lot sizes are more conducive to private well and septic systems. In some cases, smaller lot sizes can be reached by undertaking cluster development techniques that help preserve open space or a planned residential development.\nWe focused on the lot requirements for single-family detached homes, as many experts have referenced the importance of reducing lot sizes to promote affordability and reduce impacts on the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe following chart focuses on single-family detached only zoning districts.\nIn order to conduct an analysis with varying minimum lot requirements depending on district context (i.e. connection to public water and sewer, or requirements dependent on predominant lot size), we captured the minimum and maximum value listed. For example, a locality may require a minimum lot area of 0.69 acres if not connected to public infrastructure, but would require a minimum lot area of 0.23 if connected. Therefore, we collected the minimum value (0.23 acres) and the maximum value (0.69 acres). We then averaged the minimum value and the maximum value within each jurisdiction.\nThis provides a general range of the minimum lot area required for housing in single-family detached only zoning districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Average minimum lot area requirements in single-family detached only districts"

At a time when new housing is needed across the region, allowing for housing by-right (without a public hearing process) can streamline development and ensure that the housing supply is aligned with the demand.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2:  Percent of developable land that welcomes housing type by-right \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    Single-family \n    2-family \n    3-family \n    4+-family \n  \n \n\n  \n    Chesapeake \n    81% \n    4% \n    4% \n    4% \n  \n  \n    Franklin (city) \n    83% \n    15% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Gloucester \n    95% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Hampton \n    84% \n    7% \n    2% \n    2% \n  \n  \n    Isle of Wight \n    97% \n    1% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    James City \n    68% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Newport News \n    63% \n    14% \n    18% \n    19% \n  \n  \n    Norfolk \n    61% \n    12% \n    23% \n    24% \n  \n  \n    Poquoson \n    85% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Portsmouth \n    71% \n    16% \n    16% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Smithfield \n    89% \n    0% \n    3% \n    3% \n  \n  \n    Southampton \n    98% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Suffolk \n    89% \n    2% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Surry \n    100% \n    0% \n    0% \n    0% \n  \n  \n    Surry (town) \n    93% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n  \n    Virginia Beach \n    86% \n    10% \n    6% \n    6% \n  \n  \n    Williamsburg \n    73% \n    15% \n    12% \n    12% \n  \n  \n    Windsor \n    91% \n    3% \n    3% \n    3% \n  \n  \n    York \n    76% \n    1% \n    1% \n    1% \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, single-family is welcomed (without a public hearing) in nearly every locality by a wide margin, while 2+ family housing is only allowed by-right by less than seven percent in most localities.

    "text": "5.7 Other requirements\nIn Hampton Roads, the additional regulations that localities place on different types of housing vary greatly. It is difficult to make one-to-one comparisons with specific requirements like minimum lot size, setbacks, and lot coverage, even with the National Zoning Atlas Methodology.\n\n\n\n\n5.7.1 Minimum dwelling square footage\nTwo jurisdictions, the cities of Hampton and Poquoson, have minimum square footage requirements for housing. In Poquoson, the single-family minimum square footage requirement ranges from 950 square feet to 1,300 square feet. These are modest size homes that are typical.\nIn Hampton, the minimum square footage ranges from 800 to 2,250 square feet. Large square footage requirements of 2,000 or more square feet exist in the R-13, R-22, and R-33 zoning districts (they also exist in the R-43 and R-LL districts, but they are not mapped).\nVisit the link here to learn more about how minimum dwelling sizes are impacting affordability.\n\n\n5.7.2 Parking minimums\nWhen it comes to multifamily housing development, parking requirements can add up, reducing density, increasing costs, and encouraging more frequent personal vehicle travel. Surface parking lots take up valuable developable land, while parking structures are quite costly.\nEliminating or reducing parking minimums has gained momentum across the nation.\nThe table below shows minimum parking requirements for multifamily housing developments of 4 or more units in each Hampton Roads locality:\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3:  Minimum parking requirements for ‘multifamily’ housing in Hampton Roads \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    1-Bedroom \n    2-Bedroom \n    3-Bedroom \n    Vistor Space/Unit \n  \n \n\n  \n    Chesapeake \n    2 \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Franklin (city) \n    1 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0.25 \n  \n  \n    Gloucester \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0.33 \n  \n  \n    Hampton \n    1 \n    1.5 \n    2 \n    0.2 \n  \n  \n    Isle of Wight \n    1 \n    2 \n    2.25 \n    0.2 \n  \n  \n    James City County \n    1.5 \n    2.2 \n    2.2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Newport News \n    1.5* \n    1.5* \n    1.5* \n    0* \n  \n  \n    Norfolk \n    1.5-1.75* \n    1.5-1.75* \n    1.5-1.75* \n    0* \n  \n  \n    Poquoson city \n    1.5 \n    2 \n    2 \n    0.25 \n  \n  \n    Portsmouth \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Smithfield \n    2 \n    2 \n    2 \n    0.33 \n  \n  \n    Southampton \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Suffolk \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Surry \n    2 \n    2.25 \n    2.5 \n    0.33 \n  \n  \n    Surry (town) \n    NA \n    NA \n    NA \n    NA \n  \n  \n    Virginia Beach \n    2, 1.75 in excess of 50 units \n    2, 1.75 in excess of 50 units \n    2, 1.75 in excess of 50 units \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Williamsburg \n    1.25 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0.25 \n  \n  \n    Windsor \n    2 \n    2 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    York \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    1.5 \n    0.33 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany jurisdictions in Hampton Roads adhere to similar off-street parking requirements for multifamily housing developments. Suffolk is notable for having the lowest parking minimums for multifamily housing, but, no jurisdiction has eliminated parking minimums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome jurisdictions utilize overlay districts to reduce or eliminate parking minimums in certain areas.\n\n\nNewport News is notable because they have no parking requirements listed for multifamily buildings other than multiple-family attached buildings (i.e. garden-style apartments)1. Norfolk’s parking requirements are wholly dependent on which Character District the zoning district lies within, therefore it ranges from 1.5 to 1.75 spaces.\nPlanning for housing around public transportation routes can reduce traffic congestion and also increase community vitality. Light rail (like the Tide in Norfolk) or Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) can help make public transportation faster, more efficient, and attractive to a broad range of residents.\nVisit the link here to hear from a planner’s perspective on parking."

It is also important to note that while localities may be generous with the allowance of ADUs, others place additional restrictions on how they can be used.

    "section": "6.1 Introduction",
    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nIn recent years, policymakers have sought solutions to the housing shortages that plague their constituents with increasing urgency. Following decades of research and increasing activist pressure to reduce restrictions on homebuilding, these policymakers and scholars are looking critically at zoning regulations and local rules that shape the type and quantity of housing allowed to be built. Local policymakers largely determine their own zoning rules and permit-approval processes, and learning how land use is regulated across locales requires consulting zoning ordinances in tens of thousands of jurisdictions in the United States.\nThe lack of data on zoning regulations in various local jurisdictions where they are enacted has previously inhibited research on how these rules specifically affect housing construction and prices. The National Zoning Atlas (NZA) addresses the limited information on zoning rules across the country by compiling data on rules that constrain housing construction. Researchers at the NZA along with local teams across the country have been contributing to the atlas since 2020, with complete data for nearly 3,000 jurisdictions so far. Over the past year, our team added Northern Virginia to the NZA database, creating an in-depth picture of the current regulation of housing in one of the nation’s most prosperous regions.\nIn this policy brief, we explain the value of collecting data on zoning and the NZA methodology, we detail results from our analysis of regulations in Northern Virginia, and we provide context for our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Northern Virginia"

    "section": "6.2 Measuring Zoning",
    "text": "6.2 Measuring Zoning\nThe NZA project is an effort to provide granular data on land use regulations for each zone in the country where housing is allowed. After identifying the zoning districts within a jurisdiction, analysts log whether the districts are primarily residential, mixed with residential (namely, mixed use including residential), or nonresidential. Primarily residential zones allow housing and may permit limited other uses, such as schools, churches, and utilities. Mixed with residential zones generally allow housing and retail or office development. Nonresidential zones include industrial zones, which may have health and safety reasons for separation from housing, along with commercial zones where housing is not permitted, government zones, and land zoned for open space.\nThe atlas also provides detail on whether rules allow for one, two, three, or four or more housing units on a lot and how the size and shape of those buildings are restricted. This requires analysts to investigate questions such as these: Are two-family structures allowed to be built at all? Are they only allowed after a public hearing? How much land area do they require?\nFor zones that allow residential construction, the atlas includes data on the following regulations:\n\nMinimum lot size\nFront setback\nSide setback\nRear setback\nMaximum lot coverage\nMinimum parking spaces\nMaximum stories\nMaximum height\nMaximum floor-to-area ratio\nMinimum unit size\n\nFor two-, three-, and four-plus-family housing, the following regulations are added:\n\nMaximum density\nConnection to utilities and/or transit (3 and 4+ family only)\nMaximum bedrooms (3 and 4+ family only)\nMaximum units per building (4+ family only)\n\nThe atlas also includes regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs), affordable housing, and planned residential developments. This rich data collection provides value for a range of audiences. Although not all atlas teams have made their complete datasets public, many have. The full dataset on zoning in Virginia will be available on the NZA website, with regional teams’ data being added as they are completed.2 These data will provide researchers with the tools to estimate answers to questions such as, “What combination of rules makes duplex construction feasible?” or “To what extent do builders choose to provide off-street parking when zoning rules don’t require it?”\nCurrently, the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI)3 developed in 2006 and updated in 2018, is one of the most widely used tools for comparing zoning regulations across the United States. The index is derived from survey data collected from a municipal employee or an elected official in US localities. The 2018 survey received partial or full responses in 2,844 localities.\nWRLURI questions on land use policy fit into three buckets: (1) the permitting processes, (2) the rules limiting housing construction (i.e., minimum lot size requirements), and (3) the time the permitting process requires for different types of residential development. The WRLURI is the first tool to have provided researchers with the ability to compare the burden of zoning rules across jurisdictions and, together, the 2006 and 2018 data are the first measurement of the change in land use regulations across the country over time. Some studies use more detailed data on land use restrictions, but they tend to cover small geographical areas.4\nResearch using the WRLURI and other proxies for the burden of land use regulations across regions has shown that these rules have significant effects on housing markets and the broader economy. More restrictive land use regulations are associated with higher housing costs, more residential segregation, reduced income mobility, and even lower fertility rates.5\nAlthough a growing body of research indicates that local zoning regulations have important effects on housing affordability and economic opportunity, researchers have not had precise data on local zoning rules across the country to study the effects of specific land use regulations. For example, the WRLURI provides data on whether a locality has any large lot zoning, but it lacks data on specific lot size requirements across zones.\nThe atlas also creates new opportunities for apples-to-apples comparisons of zoning in localities across the United States, potentially pointing policymakers to zoning reform opportunities that are well suited to their jurisdictions. Advocates can use the data to see specifically how reform proposals will change what can be built in their states or localities. In the following section, we describe the NZA findings in Northern Virginia for major categories of residential land use restrictions."

    "section": "6.3 Residential Land Use Rules in Northern Virginia",
    "text": "6.3 Residential Land Use Rules in Northern Virginia\nWe have gathered zoning data for the 23 jurisdictions with a total of 534 zones in the Northern Virginia region (Figure 6.1).6 The region includes four counties (Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William) and five independent cities (Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax City, Manassas, and Manassas Park). Across all of Northern Virginia, 84 percent of developable land is categorized as primarily residential under the NZA’s typology, encompassing residential districts and agricultural districts, which generally permit housing construction by right, but excluding most mixed-use districts (Figure 6.2). The percentage of land zoned for primarily residential uses varies widely by locality, with Manassas Park being the lowest (26.4 percent) and Hillsboro being the highest (98.7 percent). Eight percent of the land in Northern Virginia is classified mixed with residential, with the remaining 8 percent classified as nonresidential.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Jurisdictions in Northern Virginia Exercising Zoning Authority\n\n\n\nSingle-family detached houses, the most expensive type of housing, are the only form of housing allowed in many primarily residential districts. In general, once a neighborhood is developed with detached single-family houses, zoning locks this development pattern in place, preventing the neighborhood from accommodating more people even if demand for housing and house prices increase markedly.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Share of Land Dedicated to Residential and Nonresidential Uses\n\n\n\nThe share of land zoned for exclusively single-family houses similarly varies across jurisdictions (Figure 6.3). The small towns of Clifton and Hillsboro are zoned almost entirely for single-family detached housing, whereas none of the primarily residential land in Arlington or Alexandria is restricted to single-family detached homes any longer, following 2023 reforms in both localities. Many commercial districts in Arlington, by contrast, still permit single-family detached homes by right while requiring a public hearing process for other residential uses; this is unaffected by the 2023 ordinance, which specifically revised the regulations in what had been single-family-home residential districts. However, the County Board approves extensive multifamily housing in these commercial zones through its special exemption process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Percent of Developable Residential or Mixed with Residential Land Where Only Detached Single-Family Housing is Allowed\n\n\n\n\nAlthough single-family zoning as a category rightly receives much focus from advocates and policymakers, the cost and density of single-family development varies widely across different single-family zones. Minimum lot size regulations determine how much land is required for each single-family house. The requirements for lot size in a given zone often vary depending on whether sewer and water infrastructure or other public services are available. To compare minimum lot size requirements across jurisdictions, we calculate each locality’s average minimum lot size required for land on which only detached single-family housing is allowed by right, assuming that any infrastructure needed for the smallest required lot size is already in place. Of the 20 jurisdictions in Northern Virginia, 13 have an average of less than one acre (Figure 6.4). Lovettsville has the smallest average minimum lot size of 0.16 acres, whereas Round Hill has by far the largest with 5.24 acres. Nationally, the median new-construction house has a lot size of about 0.18 acres.7\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Minimum Lot Size Requirements in Zones Where Only Detached Single-Family Housing is Allowed By-Right\n\n\n\nLand on which buildings with four or more units are allowed is just 9.5 percent of land overall (Figure 6.5). In most Northern Virginia jurisdictions, multifamily construction is primarily confined to downtown or other commercial areas. This situation also varies significantly across jurisdictions, with 73 percent of Arlington allowing for these buildings but none of Clifton, Hamilton, or Hillsboro allowing for them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Percent of Developable Residential Land Zoned for 4+ Units per Lot\n\n\n\n\nAccessory dwelling units have emerged as one of the most popular tools for fighting the housing shortage. ADUs are secondary housing units on a piece of land zoned for another use. They are most commonly built on single-family lots as basement apartments, backyard cottages, or converted garages. ADUs offer a means to increase the number of housing units available for occupancy without dramatically changing the built environment (or in some cases, without changing the built environment at all). On 65 percent of the developable land in Northern Virginia, ADUs are allowed by right, including on 77 percent of land zoned exclusively for single-family detached housing (Figure 6.6).\n\n\nReading layer `nova_region' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\ericv\\Desktop\\github\\virginiazoningatlas\\data\\nova\\geo\\nova_region.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 23 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -77.9622 ymin: 38.50079 xmax: -77.03217 ymax: 39.3246\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Land Where Accessory Dwelling Units are allowed by-right in Northern Virginia by Zoning Type\n\n\n\nHowever, even where ADUs are allowed to be built, common regulations can dramatically limit their feasibility. These rules include limits on who can live in the ADU, such as age or employment restrictions; parking requirements for the ADU; or a requirement that in order to rent the ADU, the property owner must live in either the primary dwelling unit or the ADU.8 No jurisdictions in Northern Virginia allow homeowners to build ADUs without at least one of these restrictions, severely limiting their feasibility.\nIn addition to enabling ADUs to be constructed, altering zoning to permit moderately more primary housing units to be built in single-family neighborhoods is another popular pathway for zoning reform. This approach is referred to as “light-touch density,” “missing middle housing,” or “gentle density.”9 These reforms include changes to single-family zones to allow duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes. Reforms can also include allowing denser development of single-family homes, such as by decreasing minimum lot sizes or legalizing townhouses. We measured the amount of land in Northern Virginia that meets the following criteria: zoning allows for two- or three-family housing or allows for single-family housing, including townhouses, on lots less than 2,500 square feet. The resulting area is 20.8 percent of the total land (Figure 6.7).\n\n\nReading layer `nova_region' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\ericv\\Desktop\\github\\virginiazoningatlas\\data\\nova\\geo\\nova_region.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 23 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -77.9622 ymin: 38.50079 xmax: -77.03217 ymax: 39.3246\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84"

    "text": "7.1 Conclusion\nThe NZA data provide an important new tool for advocates of zoning reform and open up new opportunities for researchers to study the effects of specific zoning rules and combinations of rules. We find that in spite of high demand to live in Northern Virginia, a majority of the land cannot be developed with more than one detached housing unit, and requirements for large lots are pervasive. Nonetheless, in many peer regions of the country, barriers to housing construction are higher, corresponding with more severe affordability problems. Northern Virginia already has a successful blueprint for reforming exclusionary zoning with examples such as Arlington’s transit corridors. The zoning atlas provides details on the rules facilitating construction across the region, pointing to reforms that could address the housing shortage in the large parts of the region where development is currently locked out."

    "text": "Richmond Magazine’s “It Takes More Than A Village” article recently highlighted the challenges the Richmond regional housing market continues to face. Housing costs - both for rental and homeownership - are up significantly from where they were over a decade ago and the abundant supply has dwindled to a trickle.\nThe Census Building Permit Survey from 2000 to 2022 shows that single-family construction starts have been on the way to recovery since the Great Recession.1 But they still pale in comparison to pre-Recession numbers. The market shift to multifamily in the past few years speaks to not only growing preferences among households, but also the challenges residents face in accessing the homeownership market (e.g., interest rates, increasing debt, competition with cash buyers, etc.).\nThe region, not unlike others in the Commonwealth, is very much lacking in the construction of smaller two to four unit buildings, so often seen in the historic neighborhoods of Richmond. This “Missing Middle” is literally missing in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Total new residential building permits issued from 2000 to 2023\n\n\n\n\nSingle-family construction starts (which includes single-family attached housing) are high in the largest counties in the region, where greenfield development opportunities are numerous. Infill development opportunities in the City of Richmond limit the ability for substantial new supply of homeownership, but opportunities still exist for resale and redevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Total new single-family residential building permits issued from 2000 to 2023\n\n\n\n\nObserving variations across jurisdictions, it may surprise many that Chesterfield County exceeds the City of Richmond in 2-4 unit and 5 or more unit construction starts. Henrico County also exceeds Richmond in terms of the number of 2-4 unit residential buildings. As noted previously in a footnote, building permit data from the Census Bureau should be taken with caution. But generally, the region continues to underbuild in the face of a rising population. The University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center noted that between 2020 and 2023, the Richmond region saw the greatest increase in new residents (+40,000). The relative affordability of the region compared to other major metros along the Mid-Atlantic and the continued proliferation of remote work opportunities has continued to bring residents — often with higher incomes — to the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Total new 2+ residential building permits issued from 2000 to 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demand from new residents and the undersupply of housing has contributed to significant price increases in recent years. The median home sales price in the Richmond Metropolitan Area has reached $400,000 as of the second quarter of 2024. This is a far cry from 2014 when the median price was under $200,000. And while it is important to note that the value of the dollar has changed over time, everyday people interpret home prices based on their experience at the time. For that reason, we present the median home sales price in nominal dollars (i.e. what the price was at that time) and real dollars (i.e., what the price is in current dollars).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Median home sales price in Richmond MSA\n\n\n\n\nThe days on market for homes has decreased across the Commonwealth as buyers compete for the little supply that exists out there. The median days on market has remained below 30 days along the I-95/I-64 corridor. In the Richmond region, the median days on market has barely risen above 10 days since the onset of the pandemic and is on par with the competition and demand seen in the DC Metro Area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Median days on market in the Urban Crescent\n\n\n\nWith home prices continuing to rise in the region, it is no surprise that the share of renters has increased. Those increases from 2010 to 2022 were most prevalent in Henrico and Goochland. But overall, every locality other than Powhatan and New Kent have seen an increase in their share of renters. The demand for rental continues to rise in the region as homeownership becomes more and more out-of-reach even for middle-income households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Percent of renter households in the PlanRVA region\n\n\n\n\nRents saw major nominal jumps in 2021. Increased rental demand amid COVID protections led to less unit turnover and even less available supply, leading to subsequent rent increases. Recent data from CoStar Group, Inc. estimates that the average asking rent in the region is just over $1,400. For a household to not be rent cost-burdened, they would have to make approximately $56,000 annually. This figure is about $18,000 more than the median renter household income in the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area - $48,171 in 2022. Based on these estimates, more than half of renters in the entire metro area could not afford rent in the Richmond region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Average asking rent in Richmond region\n\n\n\nA healthy rental vacancy rate is dependent on various factors, including location and economic conditions. Generally, a rate between 5 and 10 percent is considered balanced between supply and demand. Before the pandemic, the rental vacancy rate in the region sat between 6 and 8 percent. During the pandemic, that rate dropped below 5 percent, before climbing to a record 9 percent in the last quarter of 2023. According to the Virginia REALTORS, “the rise in vacancy rates is attributed to the apartment construction boom of 2022 as builders attempted to meet the need for more housing.”\nWhile this may indicate an oversupply, lease up will continue to occur as new inventory hits the market and vacancy rates will trend down in the coming quarters. Rent growth may slow as more units are continuously added to the region, but one fact remains, the income for many renters is not keeping pace.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: Rental vacancy in Richmond region\n\n\n\nThe Richmond region’s for-sale market has continued to see major increases in sales prices, while rents follow albeit at a slower pace. But the fact remains that more diverse types of housing are needed in both the for-sale and rental markets. Zoning can act as an artificial limiter on the housing supply and as we will see in the next section, there are dozens of opportunities to increase supply in all parts of the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Pagnucco, a writer on state and local politics, has written about the potential pitfalls of Census Building Permit Survey in accurately accounting for building starts in his piece This Mess Must Be Fixed. To that end, it must be noted that BPS relies on localities to voluntarily submit accurate data to the Census Bureau. Estimates shown may not be completely accurate depending on the locality and their participation in the survey. In lieu of data directly from the locality, BPS often serves as the sole source of this information.↩︎"

    "section": "9.2 Type of Zoning",
    "text": "9.2 Type of Zoning\nLike other regions in Virginia, the Richmond region is compromised mainly of primarily residential zoning districts - 91 percent of developable land. Only three percent of land in the region allows for a mix of residential and other uses, while the remaining six percent is dedicated to nonresidential uses like conservation lands or industrial uses. The City of Richmond, unsurprisingly, contains the most Mixed with Residential zoning type (14%), but is followed by New Kent County at 10 percent. New Kent County’s permissiveness around mixed-use zoning is related to its use of Planned Unit Developments, which theoretically allow for a mix of uses, but does not necessarily mean that a mixed-use development will be built.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Share of Land Dedicated to Residential and Nonresidential Uses\n\n\n\nRichmond’s percentage of land dedicated to a mixed-use zoning is high for the region and also high when compared to jurisdictions in the Hampton Roads region. But the City falls behind jurisdictions in Northern Virginia, where a fifth or more of land allows for a more intense mix of uses. The increasing importance of mixed-use zoning should not be understated. By allowing for more diverse uses close to housing, communities can increase their environmental sustainability and promote more walkable communities. Mixed-use zoning also can have impacts on affordability by reducing a household’s second largest expense after housing - transportation."

    "section": "9.3 Residential Zoning in the Richmond Region",
    "text": "9.3 Residential Zoning in the Richmond Region\nThe dominance of single-family detached housing development has contributed to the lack of mixed-use development in the region. In the region, 60 percent of land is dedicated to only single-family detached housing, the most expensive type of housing. Both Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia have higher percentages of land dedicated to this type of housing - 71 percent and 74 percent, respectively. But it is important to note the key difference in the Richmond region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Percent of Developable Land Where Only Detached Single-Family Housing\n\n\n\n\nIt may surprise many that Chesterfield and Charles City County dedicate zero percent of land to single-family detached only housing. But Chesterfield County allows for higher density in districts that are predominantly single-family detached through a public hearing process, and Charles City County allows for the development of 2-family housing by-right in their agricultural and residential districts. The following tables provide a better understanding of this nuance in the larger jurisdictions in the region. While Chesterfield may technically allow for more housing throughout more of its boundaries than other localities, it requires much of that housing to go through a public hearing process. Meanwhile, Henrico and Richmond allow for less housing, but allow more of it by-right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Treatment of Housing Types in the Major Jurisdictions\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the region, single-family housing (both attached and detached) significantly dominates zoning ordinances. However, places like Charles City, Goochland, and New Kent do allow for 2-family housing - albeit with varying degrees of ease. Meanwhile, multifamily housing (3+) is highly limited in the more rural jurisdictions. The need to protect rural character and the high cost of infrastructure expansion contributes to the limiting of density in areas like these. But the need for diverse housing options is not solely an urban and suburban issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Treatment of Housing Types in the Surrounding Jurisdictions”\n\n\n\nLarge minimum lot sizes for single-family housing also contribute to decreasing affordability. By requiring a large amount of land for a single home, builders and developers look to maximize home square footage and other features to meet a return on their investment. In turn, homes on large lots are often outside the range of affordability for many households in the region. The chart below showcases the average of minimum lot sizes for single-family housing in each jurisdiction. The more rural jurisdictions like Hanover have lot sizes well over one acre, with Charles City and Powhatan have lot minimums closer to four acres per single-family home. Lot sizes are often influenced by historical development patterns, but those same patterns have also contributed to the supply crunch we continue to face. By eliminating lot minimums or decreasing them, jurisdictions can open more opportunities for residential development. In rural communities, smaller lot sizes in strategic areas can serve as a way to preserve rural character and open space.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Minimum Lot Size Requirements for Single-Family Housing\n\n\n\nOur bifurcated building pattern of single-family or apartment housing has also contributed to the housing challenges we see today. The small-scale multifamily housing that we see so often throughout historic neighborhoods, like The Fan, has been zoned out in many communities. This type of development includes duplexes, triplexes, and other building layouts, where multiple households live on a single lot in a single building. This type of housing often provides ‘gentle density’ in predominantly single-family detached neighborhoods and provides opportunities for households that cannot typically afford homeownership an opportunity to live in these neighborhoods. The term Missing Middle has been used to describe this type of housing and has also gained traction across the nation. For the purposes of this analysis, zoning districts that allowed for 2 or more housing units by-right on a single lot were deemed to allow Missing Middle housing. Richmond leads the region in this type of zoning at 18 percent of developable land. Henrico follows but at a significantly lower percentage of three percent and all other jurisdictions are one percent or lower.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Percent of developable land allowing for Missing Middle (2-6 units) housing by-right\n\n\n\n\nThe region has seen a significant amount of multifamily development in recent years, but the demand for rental housing still remains high. The allowance of multifamily housing by-right contributes substantially to shortening development timelines and decreasing costs, while forcing multifamily housing through a public hearing process further stalls much needed housing or in some cases prohibits it. Richmond exceeds all jurisdictions in the amount of land that is zoned for 4+-family housing by-right. Henrico follows Richmond at nine percent, while all other jurisdictions fall at three percent or below, with some jurisdictions not allowing for any of this housing by-right.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Percent of developable land allowing for 4+ family housing by-right"

    "section": "9.4 Accessory Dwelling Units",
    "text": "9.4 Accessory Dwelling Units\nAccessory dwelling units have been positioned as another tool in the toolbox to address our supply challenges. These backyard housing units are seen as a way for homeowners to house an aging parent or adult child. ADUs can also provide homeowners with a source of additional income, by allowing them to rent the ADU or even the primary dwelling while they live in the ADU. However, local regulations can limit the size and use of ADUs in a way that can make ADU development unfeasible or undesirable.\nThe National Zoning Atlas utilizes a broad definition of ADUs to include housing that is an accessory use to commercial and other non-residential uses. This means that ADUs in the zoning atlas could include a single housing unit above a retail shop or a home associated with a cemetery. This type of housing is different from the previously referenced ADUs that are associated with a single-family home. The Virginia Zoning Atlas and National Zoning Atlas currently reflects the broader type of ADU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHousingForward Virginia recently began an ADU ordinance landscape scan in Virginia, focusing on ADUs associated with single-family housing. This analysis takes into account the different treatments of attached and detached ADUs and seeks to quantify the permissiveness of regulations.\nADUs associated with single-family housing have been an increasing policy issue across the nation. And in order to contribute to the policy discussion, HFV has sought to gather additional information on this specific type of ADU. It is the intent of HFV to leverage the zoning atlas to better quantify permissiveness of ADUs across the Commonwealth.\n\n\nMany jurisdictions in the region treat detached and attached ADUs differently - often with attached ADUs being more permissive. The data visualization below takes advantage of HFV’s scan and the Virginia Zoning Atlas to showcase the amount of land that allows for two different forms of ADUs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Treatment of ADUs by Percent of Developable Land\n\n\n\n\nThe table below highlights the different restrictions imposed on ADUs throughout the region. Restrictions vary, but the only jurisdiction in the region that prohibits ADUs is Charles City County. All other jurisdictions allow ADUs to some degree. Goochland County is the only jurisdiction that does not impose a size restriction on ADUs. The City of Richmond, Town of Ashland, Hanover County, and Powhatan County place no restrictions on occupancy of the ADU, while all other jurisdictions prohibit rental of the ADU to some degree.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1:  ADU Ordinance Summary \n \n  \n    Jurisdiction \n    Treatment \n    Term \n    Administration \n    Form \n    Approval Process \n    Size Restrictions \n    Owner Occupancy \n    Occupancy Restrictions \n    Bedroom Restrictions \n    Parking Requirements \n  \n \n\n  \n    Ashland \n    Allowed \n    Accessory apartment \n    A certificate of use and occupancy and zoning approval shall be obtained at the time of any new lease agreement.

    "text": "9.5 Zoning for Housing Near Transit\nThe Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) operates the region’s public transportation system within the City of Richmond and has expanded service into Henrico and Chesterfield counties in recent years. Transit-oriented Development (TOD) was a prominent strategy referenced through the Richmond 300 Master Plan. TOD aims to create compact, mixed-use communities near public transportation. These communities provide residents of all incomes with a multi-modal friendly environment that provides easy access to jobs, services, and other amenities.\nZoning for more dense mixed-use options near public transportation impacts more than low-income households. By reducing dependency on personal vehicles, communities can contribute to environmental sustainability and provide greater economic opportunities for all residents. The map below shows the location of GRTC bus stops and where multifamily housing (4+ units) can be developed without a public hearing.\n\n\n\n\nThe map clearly shows that there are opportunities both to expand GRTC service to reach multifamily zoned land, but also opportunities to upzone and diversify areas along transit corridors, especially Route 1 and Midlothian Turnpike.\nA quarter mile distance from transit stops is often seen as a comfortable walking distance for most people in the United States.2 Where multifamily housing is allowed in the region, there are stark differences in the relationship between multifamily zoned land and transit stop location.\nThe prevalence of public transit stops in the City of Richmond has undoubtedly contributed to the fact that out of all multifamily zoned land, nearly 80 percent of that land is within a quarter mile of a transit stop. That percentage drops significantly in the counties where GRTC operates. In Henrico, only 32 percent of multifamily zoned land is within a reasonable walking distance of public transportation. In Chesterfield County, that figure is below one percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Multifamily Zoning w/in a Quarter Mile of GRTC Stops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies for Transit-Oriented Development\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have helped to compile research and information on best practices and successful strategies to support affordable housing development. Their Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) has several articles about transit-oriented development in support of affordable housing.\nSee below:\nHousing Affordability in Transit-Oriented Developments\nMaking Transit and Affordable Housing Work Together"

    "text": "9.6 Zoning for Equity\nThe undersupply of housing impacts households regardless of income, but the impact is felt hardest by low- and moderate-income households. And too often, the disparities in income also fall along racial and ethnic lines. In the Richmond region, Black and Hispanic households make a fraction of what their white and Asian counterparts make.\nBased on the median household income of different racial and ethnic groups in the Richmond Metropolitan Area, the typical household within each group can largely afford the typical rent in the PlanRVA region ($1,459). But when it comes to homeownership, Black and Hispanic households have a more difficult time affording the median home sales price - even with a 20 percent down payment.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.3:  Income and Affordability by Race in the Region \n \n  \n    Race or Ethnicity \n    Median Household Income \n    Affordable Rent (30% of Income) \n    Affordable Homeownership (3% down) \n    Affordable Homeownership (20% down) \n  \n \n\n  \n    Black \n    $56,497 \n    $1,412.42 \n    $174,966 \n    $212,146 \n  \n  \n    Asian \n    $112,105 \n    $2,802.62 \n    $387,480 \n    $469,819 \n  \n  \n    Multiracial \n    $81,497 \n    $2,037.42 \n    $270,507 \n    $327,989 \n  \n  \n    White, non-Hispanic \n    $95,671 \n    $2,391.78 \n    $324,675 \n    $393,668 \n  \n  \n    Hispanic or Latino \n    $66,119 \n    $1,652.98 \n    $211,737 \n    $256,732 \n  \n\n\n\na Note: Purchase assumes a 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortage at 6.46%, $250 monthly insurance, and a household pays no more than 28% on housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are numerous historical and contemporary factors that continue to disadvantage people of color in the housing market, a major factor is also the the lack of diverse and abundant housing supply. With homeownership being a challenge for most households, the rental housing market is surging — further locking in households to renting and locking them out of opportunities to build equity.\nAnd while the region is building more multifamily housing than it ever has, it is still not enough to meet the demand. Most by-right multifamily housing is relegated to the City of Richmond and the median home value in census tracts where the overwhelming majority of the population is white (70 percent or more) is simply out of reach for most Black and Hispanic households. These areas cannot even be easily diversified because zoning does not easily allow for the development of housing that more diverse communities can afford.\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows where multifamily housing (4+ units) is allowed by-right and the location of majority white (70 percent or more) census tracts are and the median home value in those areas. Homeownership is largely out-of-reach for most Black and Hispanic households in those areas. And worse yet, traditional rental opportunities are not permitted there. These factors contribute to continued economic and racial segregation. Less diverse housing options also means less diverse communities.\nResearchers from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University previously highlighted housing segregation and its connection to educational inequality in “Confronting School and Housing Segregation in the Richmond Region: Can We Learn and Live Together?”. Their research showed that low opportunity neighborhoods are significantly tied to segregated, high poverty schools and that affordable housing opportunities are not in close proximity to high opportunity schools. The map below shows the location of schools wherein the percentage of Black and Latino students is lower than 40 percent. The grey dots represent schools where the percentage of Black and Latino is greater than or equal to 40 percent. The region’s diverse schools are concentrated in the the City of Richmond, eastern Henrico, and Chesterfield along the Route One corridor.\n\n\n\n\nWith the Virginia Zoning Atlas we can investigate zoning around schools based on their diversity. While school districts cover many miles, the presence of affordable housing in close proximity to schools can lead to greater opportunity for minority students. But the ability to build affordable housing near high opportunity schools can be stifled by zoning. The chart below looks at zoned, developable land within a one-mile buffer around white majority schools (less than 40 percent Black and Latino) and diverse schools (40 percent or more Black and Latino) in relation to where apartments (4+ unit housing) are allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.11: Multifamily (4+) zoning near schools\n\n\n\nIn the City of Richmond there is a stark difference around zoning and school diversity. Whiter schools in the city have less opportunities for housing diversity around them. Twelve percent of developable land around white majority schools allows for multifamily housing, compared to 21 percent around more diverse schools. In Henrico, there is greater apartment zoning around whiter schools, which are largely located in the western part of the county. This part of the county sees more high-end multifamily development, while the eastern part of the county is much more rural. Hanover County sees a similar relationship as in Henrico, but this is due in part to the location of schools along major corridors like Chamberlayne Road and Mechanicsville Turnpike. The percentage of developable land around Chesterfield County schools that allows for apartments by-right is significantly low - both for its diverse and non-diverse schools. In other parts of the region, the relationship is not as clear due to the lack of diverse schools."

    "text": "9.7 Conclusions\nIn comparison to its peers along the I-64/I-95 corridor, the PlanRVA region zones more similarly to the Hampton Roads region than the Northern Virginia region in terms of types of zoning districts. But when looking at the ability to develop different types of housing, more communities in the Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia regions allow for more diverse housing. Undoubtedly, the presence of more independent urban cities in those planning district regions relates to more diverse housing.\nHowever, the influx of new residents to the Richmond region continues to put pressure on the existing housing market, most impacting low- and moderate-income residents already living in the region. With demand only increasing, it will be important for the region - not just one or two individual jurisdictions - to consider how reforming their zoning can contribute to a more vibrant and sustainable region for both new and existing residents.\nAs noted previously, the Virginia Zoning Atlas provides a new resource for advocates of zoning reform and opportunities to investigate the intersection of housing and its many intersecting issue areas. From transportation to education, the Virginia Zoning Atlas can lead to more informed decisions about zoning and land use policy in the Richmond region and beyond."

But the fact remains that more diverse types of housing are needed in both the for-sale and rental markets. Zoning can act as an artificial limiter on the housing supply and as we will see in the next section, there are dozens of opportunities to increase supply in all parts of the region."

At the time of this analysis, the Chesterfield County and the City of Richmond were undergoing comprehensive modernizations of their zoning ordinances.\n\n\n\nHousingForward Virginia analyzed over 200 individual base and overlay zoning districts in the region. The analysis that follows excludes overlay districts because they often had no impact on how a residential use was treated. The following analysis involves 203 zoning districts across nine jurisdictions.1 In order to calculate developable land, Land Use Atlas, Inc. and HousingForward Virginia processed geospatial data to exclude protected lands and rights-of-way from the analysis utilizing PAD-US data, NHDPlus High Res data, and Regrid parcel data.\nThe results of our analysis are based on the zoning ordinances and zoning maps of each jurisdiction. It is important to note that restrictive covenants, proffered conditions, and parcel-level changes through special exceptions or special use permits also impact the ability to build housing, but they are outside the scope of this analysis."
