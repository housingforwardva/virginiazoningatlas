Relative to some high-demand parts of the country, Virginia’s regulatory burden is lighter. The slowestgrowing jurisdiction (Fairfax County) grew 5.23 percent from 2010 to 2022, the median jurisdiction (Manassas) grew 12.75 percent, and the fastest-growing jurisdiction (Loudoun County) grew 38.35 percent (Figure 7.1). As a point of comparison, California grew only 4.6 percent over this time and has lost population in the most recent years.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-nova-city-pop\n#| fig-cap: \"Population Growth Across Northern Virginia from 2010 to 2022\"\n\n# Create a visualization that shows population change in the region by city.

Between 2019 and 2023, the greater Washington, DC, area saw an increase of roughly 13 percent after adjusting for inflation. Out of nine jurisdictions, only two, Arlington County and Falls Church, saw a decline in the median sale price during this period.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-nova-price\n#| fig-cap: \"Median home sales price in Northern Virginia\"\n\n# What have home prices been like?\n\n# How to add arrows indicating direction on line segments??\n\nnova_var_price <- read_rds(\"data/nova/rds/nova_var_price.rds\")\n  \nsubtitle_text <- \"In <span style = 'color:#011E41'><b>Q2 2019</b></span> and <span style = 'color:#40C0C0'><b>Q2 2023</span>\"\n\n\nprice_plot <- ggplot(nova_var_price,\n       aes(x = reorder(name, latest),\n           y = med_price,\n           color  = period)) +\n  theme_hfv() +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point_interactive(aes(\n           data_id = med_price,\n           tooltip = dollar_format()(med_price))) +\n  geom_text(data = subset(nova_var_price, \n                          name %in% c(\"Washington MSA\")),\n            aes(label = dollar(med_price),\n                hjust = ifelse(period == \"2023 Q2\", -0.25, 1.25)), \n            size = 3) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(subtitle = subtitle_text,\n       caption = \"**Source:** Virginia REALTORS, adjusted to Q2 2023 dollars.\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(), limits = c(300000, 1100000)) +\n  scale_color_hfv() +\n  plot_annotation(\n    theme = theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(\n       margin = margin(b = 0.4, unit = 'cm'),\n        size = 11.5\n    ))) + \n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"white\"),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"#dadada\",size = 0.2))\n  \ngirafe(ggobj = price_plot,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n```\n\nSince 2010, average rents in Northern Virginia have climbed almost \\$200 a month after adjusting for inflation (Figure 7.3); the vacancy rate has been consistently lower than the national rate, with an exception for the depths of the pandemic (Figure 7.4).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-nova-rent\n#| fig-cap: \"Average asking rent in Northern Virginia\"\n\n# What has rent been like in Northern Virginia?\n\nnova_rent <- read_rds(\"data/nova/rds/nova_costar.rds\") |> \n  select(period, rent, adj_price) |> \n  mutate(quarters = as.yearqtr(period)) |> \n  pivot_longer(2:3,\n               names_to = \"rent\",\n               values_to = \"dollars\") |> \n  filter(rent == \"adj_price\")\n\nsubtitle_text <- \"In <span style = 'color:#011E41'><b>Q4 2023 dollars</b></span>\"\n\nrent_plot <- ggplot(nova_rent,\n       aes(x = quarters,\n           y = dollars,\n           color = rent,\n           linetype = rent)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point_interactive(aes(\n    data_id = dollars,\n    tooltip = dollar_format()(dollars)\n  )) +\n  theme_hfv() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  scale_x_yearqtr(breaks = seq(from = min(nova_rent$quarters), \n                               to = max(nova_rent$quarters), \n                               by = 1),format = '%Y-Q%q') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n  labs(subtitle = subtitle_text,\n       caption = \"**Source:** CoStar Group, Inc.\") +\n  scale_color_hfv()  +\n  plot_annotation(\n    theme = theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(\n       margin = margin(b = 0.4, unit = 'cm'),\n        size = 11.5\n    ))) +\n  scale_x_yearqtr(breaks = seq(from = min(nova_rent$quarters), \n                               to = max(nova_rent$quarters), \n                               by = 1),format = '%Y') +\n  labs(subtitle = subtitle_text) + \n  scale_color_hfv()  +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"#dadada\",size = 0.1),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"#dadada\",size = 0.1),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))\n\ngirafe(ggobj = rent_plot,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-nova-rv\n#| fig-cap: \"Rental Vacancy Rate in Northern Virginia from 2010 to 2023\"\n\n\n# What has rental vacancy been like?\n\nnova_rv <- read_rds(\"data/nova/rds/nova_costar.rds\") |> \n  select(period, vacancy_rate) |> \n  mutate(quarters = as.yearqtr(period))\n\nvacancy_plot <- ggplot(nova_rv,\n       aes(x = quarters,\n           y = vacancy_rate,\n           color = vacancy_rate)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point_interactive(aes(\n    data_id = vacancy_rate,\n    tooltip = percent_format(accuracy = 0.01)(vacancy_rate)\n  )) +\n  theme_hfv() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +\n  scale_x_yearqtr(breaks = seq(from = min(nova_rv$quarters), to = max(nova_rv$quarters), by = 1),\n                  format = '%Y-Q%q') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n  labs(caption = \"**Source:** CoStar Group, Inc.\") + \n  scale_color_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\"))\n\ngirafe(ggobj = vacancy_plot,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n```\n\nAcross the country, local governments use similar types of rules to restrict housing construction, but the extent of these restrictions varies widely. The substantial affordability challenges caused by land use regulations in Northern Virginia and the DC metropolitan area notwithstanding, this region is more open to housing construction than many other metropolitan coastal regions are. For example, during the construction of rail transit in Arlington, the county upzoned nearby areas, allowing for more multifamily construction.[^part-3-2-1] Fairfax County adopted a transit-oriented development plan in Tysons, allowing a large increase in multifamily construction. Loudoun County is the region’s fastest-growing municipality owing in large part to greenfield construction, but its growth includes substantial townhouse and multifamily construction along with detached single-family construction.\n\n[^part-3-2-1]: Emily Hamilton, “How DC Densified,” Works in Progress 11 (2023).\n\nIn contrast, the suburbs of other high-income coastal regions, such as San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, and New York City, have allowed much less multifamily construction. Some of Boston’s suburbs lie in New Hampshire, a state with a completed zoning atlas. Some 93 percent of New Hampshire’s developable land is restricted to exclusively detached single-family zoning, compared with 71 percent in Northern Virginia. In New Hampshire, single-family houses on lots less than one acre are allowed on only 15 percent of developable land, whereas 69 percent of Northern Virginia’s developable land allows for plausible single-family construction on less than an acre of land.\n\nThe price of housing in the Northern Virginia area is above the national average, but the DC metropolitan area is far less expensive than comparable regions that permit less housing construction (Figure 7.5). Since the turn of the millennium, while DC’s prices have been between 47 percent and 115 percent higher than national prices, Boston’s have been 77 percent to 118 percent higher; New York’s, 80 percent to 140 percent higher; Los Angeles’s, 85 percent to 192 percent higher; and San Francisco’s, 141 percent to 309 percent higher. As the atlas data show, policymakers in Northern Virginia have ample opportunities to reduce the barriers of local land use regulations. The problems caused by housing supply constraints, however, are far worse in more heavily regulated peer regions.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-natl-prices\n#| fig-cap: \"Median Home Values in Select High-Income Coastal Regions as a Multiple of the U.S. Median\"\n\nmetro_prices <- read_csv(\"data/nova/csv/zvhi.csv\")\n\ncity_names <- c(\"United States\", \n                \"Washington, DC\", \n                \"New York, NY\", \n                \"Los Angeles, CA\", \n                \"San Francisco, CA\", \n                \"Boston, MA\")\n\nmetro_prices <- metro_prices |>\n  filter(RegionName %in% city_names)\n\nmetro_prices <- metro_prices %>%\n  gather(key = \"Date\", value = \"Price\", -c(RegionID, RegionName, RegionType, StateName, SizeRank))\n\nmetro_prices$Date <- as.Date(metro_prices$Date)\n\nmetro_prices <- metro_prices %>%\n  group_by(Date) %>%\n  mutate(relative_price = Price / Price[RegionName == \"United States\"]) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\norder_region <- metro_prices %>%\n  group_by(RegionName) %>%\n  summarise(last_relative_price = last(relative_price)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(last_relative_price)) %>%\n  pull(RegionName)\n\nmetro_prices$RegionName <- factor(metro_prices$RegionName, levels = order_region)\n\nmetro_prices_img <- ggplot(metro_prices,\n                           aes(x = Date,\n                               y = relative_price,\n                               group = RegionName,\n                               color = RegionName)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_line(data = filter(metro_prices, RegionName == \"Washington, DC\"), \n            aes(x = Date, y = relative_price), \n            linewidth = 1.5) + \n  scale_color_hfv() +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = \"4 years\",\n               date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_hfv() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.position = \"right\")\n\nmetro_prices_img\n\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NZA data provide an important new tool for advocates of zoning reform and open up new opportunities for researchers to study the effects of specific zoning rules and combinations of rules. We find that in spite of high demand to live in Northern Virginia, a majority of the land cannot be developed with more than one detached housing unit, and requirements for large lots are pervasive. Nonetheless, in many peer regions of the country, barriers to housing construction are higher, corresponding with more severe affordability problems. Northern Virginia already has a successful blueprint for reforming exclusionary zoning with examples such as Arlington’s transit corridors. The zoning atlas provides details on the rules facilitating construction across the region, pointing to reforms that could address the housing shortage in the large parts of the region where development is currently locked out.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-2plus\n#| fig-cap: \"Percent of developable land allowing for 2+ family housing by-right\" \n\n# Create a bar graph that shows the total amount of zoned land that welcomes 2+ family housing by-right\n\n\n\nnova_byright_summary <- read_rds(\"data/nova/rds/nova_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, 6:9, acres) |> # Select data fields.\n  filter(overlay == 0) |> # Filter out overlay districts.\n  mutate(total_area = sum(acres)) |> # Calculate the total area of zoned land.\n  filter(family4_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n  mutate(total_4plus = sum(acres)) |> \n  mutate(pct4plus = total_4plus/total_area)\n\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nIn addition to the authors, Milica Manojlovic, Micah Perry, Rishab Sardana, and Arthur Wright gathered data for the Northern Virginia Zoning Atlas.
