The analysis that follows excludes overlay districts because they often had no impact on how a residential use was treated. The following analysis involves 203 zoning districts across nine jurisdictions.[^part-4-2-1] In order to calculate developable land, Land Use Atlas, Inc. and HousingForward Virginia processed geospatial data to exclude protected lands and rights-of-way from the analysis utilizing PAD-US data, NHDPlus High Res data, and Regrid parcel data.\n\n[^part-4-2-1]: This includes 21 individual Community Unit Plan districts in the City of Richmond. The City of Richmond treats Community Unit Plans (CUPs) as Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) that replace the base zoning districts. If a CUP is not implemented, the base zoning district prevails. There were 21 CUPs in the City of Richmond whose status was listed as active.\n\nThe results of our analysis are based on the zoning ordinances and zoning maps of each jurisdiction. It is important to note that restrictive covenants, proffered conditions, and parcel-level changes through special exceptions or special use permits also impact the ability to build housing, but they are outside the scope of this analysis.\n\n## Type of Zoning\n\nLike other regions in Virginia, the Richmond region is compromised mainly of primarily residential zoning districts - 91 percent of developable land. Only three percent of land in the region allows for a mix of residential and other uses, while the remaining six percent is dedicated to nonresidential uses like conservation lands or industrial uses. The City of Richmond, unsurprisingly, contains the most Mixed with Residential zoning type (14%), but is followed by New Kent County at 10 percent. New Kent County's permissiveness around mixed-use zoning is related to its use of Planned Unit Developments, which theoretically allow for a mix of uses, but does not necessarily mean that a mixed-use development will be built.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-housing-type\n#| fig-cap: \"Share of Land Dedicated to Residential and Nonresidential Uses\"\n\n# Create a bar chart that shows the percentage of zoned in each locality by type (i.e. primarily residential, mixed with residential, nonresidential)\n\ntype <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, type, acres) \n\n\ntype_summary <- type |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction, type) |> \n  summarise(acres = sum(acres)) |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(pct = acres/sum(acres)) \n\nrva_summary <- type |> \n  group_by(type) |> \n  summarise(acres = sum(acres)) |> \n  mutate(pct = acres/sum(acres)) \n\nsubtitle_text <- \"<span style='color:#8B85CA'><b>Primarily Residential</span></b>, <span style='color:#40C0C0'><b>Mixed with Residential</span></b>, and <span style='color:#011E41'><b>Nonresidential</span></b> Zoning\"\n\n\ntype_plot <- ggplot(type_summary,\n       aes(x = fct_reorder2(jurisdiction, type, pct),\n           y = pct,\n           fill = factor(type, levels = c(\"Nonresidential\", \"Mixed with Residential\", \"Primarily Residential\")),\n           data_id = pct,\n           tooltip = percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(pct))) +\n  geom_col_interactive(position = \"stack\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  scale_fill_hfv() +\n  labs(subtitle = subtitle_text,\n       title = \"Share of Developable Land\",\n       caption = \"**Source:** HousingForward Virginia, Virginia Zoning Atlas.\"\n       ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(), expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01))) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    theme = theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(\n       margin = margin(b = 0.4, unit = 'cm'),\n        size = 11.5\n    )))\n\n\ngirafe(ggobj = type_plot,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n# write_csv(nova_summary, \"data/nova/csv/nova_ztype_region.csv\")\n# write_csv(nova_type_summary, \"data/nova/csv/nova_ztype.csv\")\n\n```\n\nRichmond's percentage of land dedicated to a mixed-use zoning is high for the region and also high when compared to jurisdictions in the Hampton Roads region. But the City falls behind jurisdictions in Northern Virginia, where a fifth or more of land allows for a more intense mix of uses. The increasing importance of mixed-use zoning should not be understated. By allowing for more diverse uses close to housing, communities can increase their environmental sustainability and promote more walkable communities. Mixed-use zoning also can have impacts on affordability by reducing a household's second largest expense after housing - transportation.\n\n## Residential Zoning in the Richmond Region\n\nThe dominance of single-family detached housing development has contributed to the lack of mixed-use development in the region. In the region, 60 percent of land is dedicated to only single-family detached housing, the most expensive type of housing. Both Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia have higher percentages of land dedicated to this type of housing - 71 percent and 74 percent, respectively. But it is important to note the key difference in the Richmond region.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-sfd-bar\n#| fig-cap: \"Percent of Developable Land Where Only Detached Single-Family Housing\"\n\n# Create a bar char that shows the percentage of zoned in each locality that is dedicated to single-family detached only housing.\n\nsfd <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> # Read in the data.\n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, type, sfd, family1_treatment, acres) |> \n  # filter(type == \"Mixed with Residential\" | type == \"Primarily Residential\") |> # Filter for only land that allows for housing?\n  mutate(acres = as.numeric(acres)) |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction, sfd) |> \n  summarise(acres = sum(acres)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(total = sum(acres)) |> \n  mutate(pct = acres/total) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  mutate(total_area = sum(unique(total)))\n\n# Total acres is 1221754\n\n# sfd_summary <- sfd |> \n#   group_by(sfd) |> \n#   summarise(acres = sum(acres)) |> \n#   mutate(pct_area = acres/1221754)\n\nsfd_locality <- sfd |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  filter(sfd == \"t\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, pct) |> \n  add_row(jurisdiction = \"Charles City\", pct = 0) |> \n  add_row(jurisdiction = \"Chesterfield\", pct = 0 )\n\n\n# sfd_explore <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> # Read in the data.\n#   select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, type, sfd, acres, family1_treatment) |> \n#   filter(type == \"Mixed with Residential\" | type == \"Primarily Residential\") |> # Select necessary data fields.\n#   mutate(acres = as.numeric(acres)) |> \n#   group_by(jurisdiction, sfd, family1_treatment) |> \n#   summarise(acres = sum(acres)) |> \n#   ungroup() |> \n#   group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n#   mutate(total = sum(acres)) |> \n#   mutate(pct = acres/total) \n\n\n\nggplot(sfd_locality,\n       aes(\n         x = reorder(jurisdiction, pct),\n         y = pct\n         )) +\n  geom_col_interactive(\n    position = \"dodge\", \n    fill = \"#40c0c0\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = percent(pct, 1)), \n    color = \"#40c0c0\", \n    size = 5,\n    hjust = -0.2\n    ) +\n  theme_hfv(\n    base_size = 15\n    ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +\n  # scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  # scale_color_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  labs(title = \"Developable land where only single-family detached housing can be built\",\n       caption = \"**Source:** HousingForward Virginia, Virginia Zoning Atlas.\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n# write_csv(nova_sfd, \"data/nova/csv/nova_sfd.csv\")\n# write_csv(nova_sfd_summary, \"data/nova/csv/nova_sfd_region.csv\")\n# \n# \n\n\n```\n\nIt may surprise many that Chesterfield and Charles City County dedicate zero percent of land to single-family detached only housing. But Chesterfield County allows for higher density in districts that are predominantly single-family detached through a public hearing process, and Charles City County allows for the development of 2-family housing by-right in their agricultural and residential districts. The following tables provide a better understanding of this nuance in the larger jurisdictions in the region. While Chesterfield may technically allow for more housing throughout more of its boundaries than other localities, it requires much of that housing to go through a public hearing process. Meanwhile, Henrico and Richmond allow for less housing, but allow more of it by-right.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-hearing\n#| tbl-cap: \"Percent of developable land that forces housing through a public

single-family housing (both attached and detached) significantly dominates zoning ordinances. However, places like Charles City, Goochland, and New Kent do allow for 2-family housing - albeit with varying degrees of ease. Meanwhile, multifamily housing (3+) is highly limited in the more rural jurisdictions. The need to protect rural character and the high cost of infrastructure expansion contributes to the limiting of density in areas like these. But the need for diverse housing options is not solely an urban and suburban issue.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-hearing-4\n#| fig-cap: Treatment of Housing Types in the Surrounding Jurisdictions\"\n\ntreatment_tbl <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/treatment_tbl.rds\") |> \n  filter(jurisdiction == \"Ashland\" | jurisdiction == \"Charles City\" | jurisdiction == \"Hanover\" | jurisdiction == \"New Kent\"| jurisdiction == \"Powhatan\" | jurisdiction == \"Goochland\")\n\ntreatment_tbl$treatment <- factor(treatment_tbl$treatment, levels = c(\"prohibited\", \"hearing\", \"byright\"))\nx_axis_order <- c(\"Single-family\", \"2-family\", \"3-family\", \"4+-family\")\ntreatment_tbl$type <- factor(treatment_tbl$type, levels = x_axis_order)\n\nsubtitle_text <- \"Percent of developable land that allows for housing <span style='color:#40C0C0'><b>By-right</span></b>, <span style='color:#8B85CA'><b>through a public hearing</span></b>, or <span style='color:grey'><b>prohibits it</span></b>\"\n\ntreatment <- ggplot(treatment_tbl,\n       aes(x = type,\n           y = pct,\n           fill = treatment)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\n  facet_grid(~jurisdiction) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"byright\" = \"#40C0C0\", \"hearing\" = \"#8B85CA\", \"prohibited\" = \"grey\")) +\n  theme_hfv() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\n  labs(title = \"Treatment of housing types\",\n       subtitle = subtitle_text)\n\ngirafe(ggobj = treatment,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n```\n\nLarge minimum lot sizes for single-family housing also contribute to decreasing affordability. By requiring a large amount of land for a single home, builders and developers look to maximize home square footage and other features to meet a return on their investment. In turn, homes on large lots are often outside the range of affordability for many households in the region. The chart below showcases the average of minimum lot sizes for single-family housing in each jurisdiction. The more rural jurisdictions like Hanover have lot sizes well over one acre, with Charles City and Powhatan have lot minimums closer to four acres per single-family home. Lot sizes are often influenced by historical development patterns, but those same patterns have also contributed to the supply crunch we continue to face. By eliminating lot minimums or decreasing them, jurisdictions can open more opportunities for residential development. In rural communities, smaller lot sizes in strategic areas can serve as a way to preserve rural character and open space.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-sfd-min\n#| fig-cap: \"Minimum Lot Size Requirements for Single-Family Housing\"\n\n# What is the average minimum lot size for each type of treatment? \n# Blank fields should be treated as NA and should not be included in the mean calculation.\n\n\nrva_lots <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  filter(family1_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n  mutate(min1 = as.numeric(min1)) |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(mean1min = round(mean(min1, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) |> \n  pivot_longer(cols = mean1min,\n               names_to = \"metric\",\n               values_to = \"avg\") |> \n  mutate(metric = \"Minimum value\") \n\n\n\nsubtitle_text <- \"*Average <span style='color:#40c0c0'><b>minimum</span></b> in acres*\"\n\nlot_plot <- ggplot(rva_lots,\n                   aes(x = reorder(jurisdiction, avg),\n                       y = avg,\n                       data_id = avg,\n                       tooltip = avg)) +\n  geom_point_interactive(color = \"#40c0c0\") +  # Change point color to #40c0c0\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Minimum lot size for single-family housing\",\n       subtitle = subtitle_text) +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, 1)) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    theme = theme(\n      plot.subtitle = element_markdown(\n        margin = margin(b = 0.4, unit = 'cm'),\n        size = 11.5)))\n\n\n\ngirafe(ggobj = lot_plot,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n\n```\n\nOur bifurcated building pattern of single-family or apartment housing has also contributed to the housing challenges we see today. The small-scale multifamily housing that we see so often throughout historic neighborhoods, like The Fan, has been zoned out in many communities. This type of development includes duplexes, triplexes, and other building layouts, where multiple households live on a single lot in a single building. This type of housing often provides 'gentle density' in predominantly single-family detached neighborhoods and provides opportunities for households that cannot typically afford homeownership an opportunity to live in these neighborhoods. The term Missing Middle has been used to describe this type of housing and has also gained traction across the nation. For the purposes of this analysis, zoning districts that allowed for 2 or more housing units by-right on a single lot were deemed to allow Missing Middle housing. Richmond leads the region in this type of zoning at 18 percent of developable land. Henrico follows but at a significantly lower percentage of three percent and all other jurisdictions are one percent or lower.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-2plus\n#| fig-cap: \"Percent of developable land allowing for Missing Middle (2-6 units) housing by-right\" \n\n# Create a bar graph that shows the total amount of zoned land that welcomes 2+ family housing by-right\n\nbyright <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, 6:9, acres) |> # Select data fields.\n  filter(overlay == 0) |> # Filter out overlay districts.\n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(total_area = sum(acres)) |> # Calculate the total area of zoned land.\n  filter(family2_treatment == \"allowed\" & family3_treatment == \"allowed\" & family4_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(pct_2plus = acres/total_area) |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(pct_2plus = sum(pct_2plus)) |> \n  add_row(jurisdiction = \"Chesterfield\", pct_2plus = 0) |> \n  add_row(jurisdiction = \"Goochland\", pct_2plus = 0) \n\n\n# byright_summary <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n#   select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, 6:9, acres) |> # Select data fields.\n#   filter(overlay == 0) |> # Filter out overlay districts.\n#   mutate(total_area = sum(acres)) |> # Calculate the total area of zoned land.\n#   filter(family2_treatment == \"allowed\" & family3_treatment == \"allowed\" & family4_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n#   mutate(total_2plus = sum(acres)) |> \n#   mutate(pct2plus = total_2plus/total_area)\n\nggplot(byright,\n       aes(x = reorder(jurisdiction, pct_2plus),\n           y = pct_2plus,\n           fill = pct_2plus)) +\n  geom_col_interactive(\n    position = \"dodge\", \n    fill = \"#011E41\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = percent(pct_2plus, 1)), \n    color = \"#011E41\", \n    size = 5,\n    hjust = -0.2\n    ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  # scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  # scale_color_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Middle Housing\",\n       subtitle = \"Allows for 2+ housing by-right\",\n       caption = \"**Source:** HousingForward Virginia, Virginia Zoning Atlas.\")  +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n```\n\nThe region has seen a significant amount of multifamily development in recent years, but the demand for rental housing still remains high. The allowance of multifamily housing by-right contributes substantially to shortening development timelines and decreasing costs, while forcing multifamily housing through a public hearing process further stalls much needed housing or in some cases prohibits it. Richmond exceeds all jurisdictions in the amount of land that is zoned for 4+-family housing by-right. Henrico follows Richmond at nine percent, while all other jurisdictions fall at three percent or below, with some jurisdictions not allowing for any of this housing by-right.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-4plus\n#| fig-cap: \"Percent of developable land allowing for 4+ family housing by-right\" \n\n# Create a bar graph that shows the total amount of zoned land that welcomes 2+ family housing by-right\n\nbyright <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, 6:9, acres) |> # Select data fields.\n  filter(overlay == 0) |> # Filter out overlay districts.\n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(total_area = sum(acres)) |> # Calculate the total area of zoned land.\n  filter(family4_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  mutate(pct_4plus = acres/total_area) |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(pct_4plus = sum(pct_4plus)) |> \n  add_row(jurisdiction = \"Goochland County\", pct_4plus = 0) |> \n  mutate(percent = percent(pct_4plus))\n\n\nbyright_summary <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, 6:9, acres) |> # Select data fields.\n  filter(overlay == 0) |> # Filter out overlay districts.\n  mutate(total_area = sum(acres)) |> # Calculate the total area of zoned land.\n  filter(family4_treatment == \"allowed\") |> \n  mutate(total_4plus = sum(acres)) |> \n  mutate(pct4plus = total_4plus/total_area) \n\nggplot(byright,\n       aes(x = reorder(jurisdiction, pct_4plus),\n           y = pct_4plus,\n           fill = pct_4plus)) +\n  geom_col_interactive(\n    position = \"dodge\", \n    fill = \"#011E41\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = percent(pct_4plus, 1)), \n    color = \"#011E41\", \n    size = 5,\n    hjust = -0.2\n    ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  # scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  # scale_color_gradientn(colours = c(\"#ADDCB1\", \"#46A88F\", \"#207A88\", \"#0F1A4E\")) + # Use custom HFV gradient.\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of developable land allowing for 4+ family housing by-right\",\n       caption = \"**Source:** HousingForward Virginia, Virginia Zoning Atlas.\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))\n\n```\n\n## Accessory Dwelling Units\n\nAccessory dwelling units have been positioned as another tool in the toolbox to address our supply challenges. These backyard housing units are seen as a way for homeowners to house an aging parent or adult child. ADUs can also provide homeowners with a source of additional income, by allowing them to rent the ADU or even the primary dwelling while they live in the ADU. However, local regulations can limit the size and use of ADUs in a way that can make ADU development unfeasible or undesirable.\n\nThe National Zoning Atlas utilizes a broad definition of ADUs to include housing that is an accessory use to commercial and other non-residential uses. This means that ADUs in the zoning atlas could include a single housing unit above a retail shop or a home associated with a cemetery. This type of housing is different from the previously referenced ADUs that are associated with a single-family home. The Virginia Zoning Atlas and National Zoning Atlas currently reflects the broader type of ADU.\n\n::: callout-important\nHousingForward Virginia recently began an ADU ordinance landscape scan in Virginia, focusing on ADUs associated with single-family housing. This analysis takes into account the different treatments of attached and detached ADUs and seeks to quantify the permissiveness of regulations.\n\nADUs associated with single-family housing have been an increasing policy issue across the nation. And in order to contribute to the policy discussion, HFV has sought to gather additional information on this specific type of ADU. It is the intent of HFV to leverage the zoning atlas to better quantify permissiveness of ADUs across the Commonwealth.\n:::\n\nMany jurisdictions in the region treat detached and attached ADUs differently - often with attached ADUs being more permissive. The data visualization below takes advantage of HFV's scan and the Virginia Zoning Atlas to showcase the amount of land that allows for two different forms of ADUs.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-hr-adus\n#| fig-cap: \"Treatment of ADUs by Percent of Developable Land\"\n\n# Create a table that shows the percentage of land that allows for ADUs by-right\n# https://frontierinstitute.org/reports/the-montana-zoning-atlas-2-0/ use this as an example \n\n# adu <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n#   select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, overlay, accessory_treatment, acres) \n# \n# write_csv(adu, \"data/planrva/csv/adu.csv\")\n\nadu <- read_csv(\"data/planrva/csv/adu.csv\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, adu_detached, adu_attached, area = acres)\n\n\ntype <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, abbrvname, type, acres) |> \n  left_join(adu, by = c(\"jurisdiction\", \"abbrvname\")) |> \n  pivot_longer(adu_detached:adu_attached,\n               values_to = \"treatment\",\n               names_to = \"adutype\") |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction, adutype, treatment) |> \n  summarise(adu_area = sum(area)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction, adutype) |> \n  mutate(total_area = sum(adu_area)) |> \n  mutate(adu_pct = adu_area/total_area) |> \n  mutate(adutype = case_when(\n    adutype == \"adu_detached\" ~ \"Detached ADU\",\n    adutype == \"adu_attached\" ~ \"Attached ADU\"\n  )) \n\n\nadu_detached <- type |> \n  filter(adutype == \"Detached ADU\") |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) %>%\n  mutate(\n    total_pct = sum(adu_pct, na.rm = TRUE),\n    allowed_hearing_pcts = sum(adu_pct[treatment %in% c(\"allowed\", \"hearing\")], na.rm = TRUE),\n    prohibited_pct = sum(adu_pct[treatment == \"prohibited\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |> \n  mutate(across(treatment, .fns = (~str_to_title(.x))))\n\nadu_attached <- type |> \n  filter(adutype == \"Attached ADU\") |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) %>%\n  mutate(\n    total_pct = sum(adu_pct, na.rm = TRUE),\n    allowed_hearing_pcts = sum(adu_pct[treatment %in% c(\"allowed\", \"hearing\")], na.rm = TRUE),\n    prohibited_pct = sum(adu_pct[treatment == \"prohibited\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |> \n  mutate(across(treatment, .fns = (~str_to_title(.x))))\n\nadu_detached$treatment <- factor(adu_detached$treatment, levels = c(\"Prohibited\", \"Hearing\", \"Allowed\"))\nadu_attached$treatment <- factor(adu_attached$treatment, levels = c(\"Prohibited\", \"Hearing\", \"Allowed\"))\n\n\nmy_colors <- c(\"Prohibited\" = \"#e2e4e3\",\n               \"Allowed\" = \"#40C0C0\",\n               \"Hearing\" = \"#8B85CA\")\n\n\nd_plot <- ggplot(adu_detached,\n       aes(x = reorder(jurisdiction, allowed_hearing_pcts),\n           y = adu_pct,\n           fill = treatment)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_hfv()  +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors)  +\n  labs(title = \"Detached ADUs\")\n\na_plot <- ggplot(adu_attached,\n       aes(x = reorder(jurisdiction, allowed_hearing_pcts),\n           y = adu_pct,\n           fill = treatment)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_hfv()  +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colors)   +\n  labs(title = \"Attached ADUs\")\n\nd_plot + a_plot\n\n\n```\n\nThe table below highlights the different restrictions imposed on ADUs throughout the region. Restrictions vary, but the only jurisdiction in the region that prohibits ADUs is Charles City County. All other jurisdictions allow ADUs to some degree. Goochland County is the only jurisdiction that does not impose a size restriction on ADUs. The City of Richmond, Town of Ashland, Hanover County, and Powhatan County place no restrictions on occupancy of the ADU, while all other jurisdictions prohibit rental of the ADU to some degree. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-adu-summary\n#| tbl-cap: \"ADU Ordinance Summary\"\n\nadu_tbl <- read_csv(\"data/planrva/csv/adu_summary.csv\") |> \n  select(juris, allowed, term, admin, form, approval,  size_restrict,\n         owner_occ, occ_restrict_detail, bedroom_restrict, park_req) |> \n  kbl(col.names = c(\"Jurisdiction\", \"Treatment\", \"Term\", \"Administration\", \"Form\", \"Approval Process\", \"Size Restrictions\", \"Owner Occupancy\", \"Occupancy Restrictions\", \"Bedroom Restrictions\", \"Parking Requirements\"), align = \"lccccccccccc\") |> \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"condensed\"),\n                font_size = 12)\n\nadu_tbl\n\n```\n\nAll jurisdictions that allow for ADUs except for New Kent County provide a specific definition of ADUs in their zoning ordinances.

Transit-oriented Development (TOD) was a prominent strategy referenced through the Richmond 300 Master Plan. TOD aims to create compact, mixed-use communities near public transportation. These communities provide residents of all incomes with a multi-modal friendly environment that provides easy access to jobs, services, and other amenities.\n\nZoning for more dense mixed-use options near public transportation impacts more than low-income households. By reducing dependency on personal vehicles, communities can contribute to environmental sustainability and provide greater economic opportunities for all residents. The map below shows the location of GRTC bus stops and where multifamily housing (4+ units) can be developed without a public hearing.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-transit-map\n#| fig-cap: \"GRTC Stops and By-Right Multifamily Zoning\"\n\nknitr::include_url(\"data/planrva/trans_map.html\", height = \"500px\")\n\n```\n\nThe map clearly shows that there are opportunities both to expand GRTC service to reach multifamily zoned land, but also opportunities to upzone and diversify areas along transit corridors, especially Route 1 and Midlothian Turnpike.\n\nA quarter mile distance from transit stops is often seen as a comfortable walking distance for most people in the United States.[^part-4-2-2] Where multifamily housing is allowed in the region, there are stark differences in the relationship between multifamily zoned land and transit stop location.\n\n[^part-4-2-2]: Walker, Jarrett. (2011). \"basics: walking distance to transit.\" Human Transit.\n\nThe prevalence of public transit stops in the City of Richmond has undoubtedly contributed to the fact that out of all multifamily zoned land, nearly 80 percent of that land is within a quarter mile of a transit stop. That percentage drops significantly in the counties where GRTC operates. In Henrico, only 32 percent of multifamily zoned land is within a reasonable walking distance of public transportation. In Chesterfield County, that figure is below one percent.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-transit-apt\n#| fig-cap: \"Multifamily Zoning w/in a Quarter Mile of GRTC Stops\"\n\n# Determine how much total land allows for 4+ family housing either by-right or through\n# public hearing.\n\ntype <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_vza_nogeo.rds\") |> \n  select(jurisdiction, type, family4_treatment, acres) |> \n  filter(family4_treatment == 'allowed' | family4_treatment == 'hearing') |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(total_area = sum(acres)) |> \n  mutate(total_area = format(total_area, scientific = FALSE))\n\n# Calculate how much developable land that allows for 4+ family housing within a\n# quarter mile of transit stops allow for that housing by-right\n\ntransit_area <- geojson_sf(\"data/planrva/geo/byright4_w_qtr_mile.geojson\") |> \n  st_drop_geometry() |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(area = sum(update_area)) |> \n  mutate(total_area = case_when(\n    jurisdiction == \"Richmond (city)\" ~ 6061.756499,\n    jurisdiction == \"Chesterfield\" ~ 138095.271176,\n    jurisdiction == \"Henrico\" ~ 14065.528323)) |> \n  ungroup() |> \n  group_by(jurisdiction) |> \n  summarise(pct = area/total_area)\n\n# Create a plot to show the percentage of land where you can build 4+ housing within\n# quarter mile of transit stops.\n\n\nggplot(transit_area,\n       aes(x = jurisdiction,\n           y = pct)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#011E41\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = percent(pct, 1)), \n    color = \"#011E41\", \n    size = 8,\n    vjust = -0.5\n    ) +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(), limits = c(0,1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Multifamily housing near transit\",\n       subtitle = \"Percent of by-right multifamily zoned land w/in a quarter mile of transit stops\")\n\n\n```\n\n::: callout-note\n## Strategies for Transit-Oriented Development\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have helped to compile research and information on best practices and successful strategies to support affordable housing development. Their Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) has several articles about transit-oriented development in support of affordable housing.\n\nSee below:\n\n[**Housing Affordability in Transit-Oriented Developments**](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-trending-051722.html)\n\n[**Making Transit and Affordable Housing Work Together**](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-featd-article-061323.html)\n:::\n\n## Zoning for Equity\n\nThe undersupply of housing impacts households regardless of income, but the impact is felt hardest by low- and moderate-income households. And too often, the disparities in income also fall along racial and ethnic lines. In the Richmond region, Black and Hispanic households make a fraction of what their white and Asian counterparts make.\n\nBased on the median household income of different racial and ethnic groups in the Richmond Metropolitan Area, the typical household within each group can largely afford the typical rent in the PlanRVA region (\\$1,459). But when it comes to homeownership, Black and Hispanic households have a more difficult time affording the median home sales price - even with a 20 percent down payment.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-income\n#| tbl-cap: \"Income and Affordability by Race in the Region\"\n\nb19013 <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/rva_b19013.rds\") |> \n  select(race, income = estimate, rent, ho_price, ho_price_20d) |> \n  mutate(income = dollar(income)) |> \n  mutate(rent = dollar(rent)) |> \n  mutate(ho_price = dollar(ho_price)) |> \n  mutate(ho_price_20d = dollar(ho_price_20d))\n\nb19013 |> kbl(col.names = c(\"Race or Ethnicity\", \"Median Household Income\", \"Affordable Rent (30% of Income)\", \"Affordable Homeownership (3% down)\", \"Affordable Homeownership (20% down)\"), align = \"lcccc\") |> \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"condensed\"),\n                font_size = 12) |> \n  add_footnote(\"Note: Purchase assumes a 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortage at 6.46%, $250 monthly insurance, and a household pays no more than 28% on housing.\") \n\n```\n\nWhile there are numerous historical and contemporary factors that continue to disadvantage people of color in the housing market, a major factor is also the the lack of diverse and abundant housing supply. With homeownership being a challenge for most households, the rental housing market is surging --- further locking in households to renting and locking them out of opportunities to build equity.\n\nAnd while the region is building more multifamily housing than it ever has, it is still not enough to meet the demand. Most by-right multifamily housing is relegated to the City of Richmond and the median home value in census tracts where the overwhelming majority of the population is white (70 percent or more) is simply out of reach for most Black and Hispanic households. These areas cannot even be easily diversified because zoning does not easily allow for the development of housing that more diverse communities can afford.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-race-map\n#| fig-cap: \"Majority White (70% or more) Census Tracts versus By-Right Multifamily\"\n\nknitr::include_url(\"data/planrva/race_map.html\", height = \"500px\")\n\n\n```\n\nThe map above shows where multifamily housing (4+ units) is allowed by-right and the location of majority white (70 percent or more) census tracts are and the median home value in those areas. Homeownership is largely out-of-reach for most Black and Hispanic households in those areas. And worse yet, traditional rental opportunities are not permitted there. These factors contribute to continued economic and racial segregation. Less diverse housing options also means less diverse communities.\n\nResearchers from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University previously highlighted housing segregation and its connection to educational inequality in [\"Confronting School and Housing Segregation in the Richmond Region: Can We Learn and Live Together?\"](https://scholarship.richmond.edu/spcs-faculty-publications/74/). Their research showed that low opportunity neighborhoods are significantly tied to segregated, high poverty schools and that affordable housing opportunities are not in close proximity to high opportunity schools. The map below shows the location of schools wherein the percentage of Black and Latino students is lower than 40 percent. The grey dots represent schools where the percentage of Black and Latino is greater than or equal to 40 percent. The region's diverse schools are concentrated in the the City of Richmond, eastern Henrico, and Chesterfield along the Route One corridor.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-school-map\n#| fig-cap: \"School Diversity in the Region\"\n\n\nknitr::include_url(\"data/planrva/school_map.html\", height = \"500px\")\n\n```\n\nWith the Virginia Zoning Atlas we can investigate zoning around schools based on their diversity. While school districts cover many miles, the presence of affordable housing in close proximity to schools can lead to greater opportunity for minority students. But the ability to build affordable housing near high opportunity schools can be stifled by zoning. The chart below looks at zoned, developable land within a one-mile buffer around white majority schools (less than 40 percent Black and Latino) and diverse schools (40 percent or more Black and Latino) in relation to where apartments (4+ unit housing) are allowed.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-school-bar\n#| fig-cap: \"Multifamily (4+) zoning near schools\"\n\nschools <- read_rds(\"data/planrva/rds/apt_zoning_schools.rds\") |> \n  filter(county != \"Powhatan County\") |> \n  filter(county != \"New Kent County\")\n  \nsubtitle_text <- \"Within one mile of <span style='color:#011E41'><b>diverse schools</span></b> and <span style='color:#40C0C0'><b>white majority schools</span></b>\"\n\nschool <- ggplot(schools,\n       aes(x = reorder(county, -pct),\n           y = pct,\n           fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  theme_hfv(base_size = 15) +\n  scale_fill_hfv() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Percent of developable land that allows for multifamily by-right\",\n       subtitle = subtitle_text,\n       caption = \"Note: Results for Powhatan were below zero. Goochland County has no zoning <br> districts that allow for apartments by-right. New Kent has no diverse schools.\") \n\ngirafe(ggobj = school,\n       height_svg = 4)\n\n```\n\nIn the City of Richmond there is a stark difference around zoning and school diversity. Whiter schools in the city have less opportunities for housing diversity around them. Twelve percent of developable land around white majority schools allows for multifamily housing, compared to 21 percent around more diverse schools. In Henrico, there is greater apartment zoning around whiter schools, which are largely located in the western part of the county. This part of the county sees more high-end multifamily development, while the eastern part of the county is much more rural. Hanover County sees a similar relationship as in Henrico, but this is due in part to the location of schools along major corridors like Chamberlayne Road and Mechanicsville Turnpike. The percentage of developable land around Chesterfield County schools that allows for apartments by-right is significantly low - both for its diverse and non-diverse schools. In other parts of the region, the relationship is not as clear due to the lack of diverse schools.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn comparison to its peers along the I-64/I-95 corridor, the PlanRVA region zones more similarly to the Hampton Roads region than the Northern Virginia region in terms of types of zoning districts. But when looking at the ability to develop different types of housing, more communities in the Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia regions allow for more diverse housing. Undoubtedly, the presence of more independent urban cities in those planning district regions relates to more diverse housing.\n\nHowever, the influx of new residents to the Richmond region continues to put pressure on the existing housing market, most impacting low- and moderate-income residents already living in the region. With demand only increasing, it will be important for the region - not just one or two individual jurisdictions - to consider how reforming their zoning can contribute to a more vibrant and sustainable region for both new and existing residents.\n\nAs noted previously, the Virginia Zoning Atlas provides a new resource for advocates of zoning reform and opportunities to investigate the intersection of housing and its many intersecting issue areas.
